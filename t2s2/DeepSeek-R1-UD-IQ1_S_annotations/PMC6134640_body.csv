"Okay, I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from the given case report. The admission event is at timestamp 0, and other events are relative to that. If there's no explicit time, I'll use clinical judgment to estimate. Let's start by reading the case report carefully.",
"The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and untreated psoriasis. She was found unconscious at her home and transferred to the hospital. Upon admission, she had various symptoms and underwent surgeries. The events before admission would have negative timestamps, and those after admission would be positive.",
"First, let's list all the events mentioned:",
- 47 years old: timestamp 0.,
"?Caucasian: not an event, but a demographic.",
?Woman: same.,
"- 26-pack-year smoking: part of history, so at 0.",
"- 10-year alcohol consumption: also part of history, at 0.",
"CUntreated chronic psoriasis vulgaris: part of history, timestamp 0.",
"Found unconscious: happened when she was found, which likely led to admission. So timestamp 0.",
"Previously treated with meropenem at a regional hospital: this was before transfer, so how long? It says she was treated every 12 hours for 2 days. So 2 days before admission? That's 48 hours before, so -48.",
"Interhospital transfer to OMFS Clinic: part of admission process, timestamp 0.",
"Evaluation and treatment of infection: part of admission, 0.",
Upon admission symptoms:,
- Normal temp: 0,
- Tachypnea: 0,
", Tachycardia: 0",
- Hypotension: 0,
- Tumefaction in face/neck: 0,
- Bilateral palpebral microabscesses: 0,
- Occipital psoriatic plaque: 0,
Ere Massive crepitations: 0.,
"Within 1 hour, emergency surgery: so surgery at +1 hour? But since the admission is timestamp 0, the surgery happened 1 hour after admission, so timestamp +1.",
"Surgical procedures mentioned here: wide excision, dressing, washing. These are part of the first surgery, timestamp +1.",
"Postoperative CT scan: after surgery, so same day, maybe +1 or +24? The CT was done after 3 days of antibiotics? Wait, the case report says after 3 days of empirical therapy, they performed another surgery. Let me check.",
"After 3 days of empirical antibiotic therapy... performed limited necrectomy... So the first surgery was at +1 hour. Then 3 days (72 hours) later, another surgery. So that's at +72 hours.",
"Then, postoperative outcome was favorable despite leukocytosis (11,000) and fever (38.8°C). This was after the second surgery? Or after the first? The first surgery outcome is mentioned after the first 3 days of antibiotics, which would be day 3, so +72 hours.",
"Then, three days later (after the second surgery?), bacteriological testing showed certain bacteria. So +72 + 72 = +144? Or the testing was done 3 days after the second surgery. Wait, the timeline is a bit confusing. Let me parse it step by step.",
First admission:,
- Admission time: 0.,
- Within 1 hour: surgery (time +1).,
"- Then, after 3 days of antibiotics (vancomycin, imipenem, metronidazole), which would be 72 hours after admission, another surgery (limited necrectomy). So that's at +72.",
"- Then, three days after that surgery, bacteriological testing done. That would be +72 + 72 = +144 hours? Or is it three days after the second surgery, which was at +72, so testing at +72 + 72 = +144.",
"Postoperative day 7: refers to days after surgery. Which surgery? Probably the first one. So if the first surgery was at +1 hour, day 7 would be +7*24 = +168 hours. But the patient had another surgery on day 7? The case report says: ""On postoperative day 7, the patient’s entire face became edematous, and we performed necrectomy..."" So this is +7 days after the first surgery? Since the first surgery was at +1 hour, day 7 would be +168 hours (7*24). So this third surgery at +168.",
"Then, on postoperative day 45: this would be 45 days after the last surgery? Or days after admission? Wait, the case says ""On postoperative day 45, the patient had clean wounds..."" It's likely days after the last surgery mentioned. So if the last surgery was on day 7, day 45 would be +45 days, which is 45*24 = 1080 hours. But this might be too long. Alternatively, maybe the timeline is counted from the first surgery. The case report mentions ""hospitalization day 76"" at discharge. So the total stay was 76 days.",
"Plastic reconstruction was done on day 45, then transferred to Plastic Surgery, and discharged on day 76. So day 45 is +45*24 = 1080 hours, discharge at +76*24 = 1824 hours.",

"Other pertinent info: no hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but that's a negative finding, so include as ""no hyperbaric oxygen therapy"" at 0? Or when?",
"Wait, the case report mentions that hyperbaric oxygen wasn't used. Since it's a pertinent negative, we can include it with timestamp 0.",
"Also, the patient had psoriasis, which is a chronic condition, so timestamp 0.",
"Possible mistakes: the first surgery was within 1 hour of admission, so timestamp +1. The empirical antibiotics were given for 3 days after the first surgery, so starting at +1 and lasting for 72 hours, but the event ""empirical antibiotic therapy"" would be at the start, so +1.",
"Wait, the case says: ""After 3 days of empirical antibiotic therapy..., we performed a limited necrectomy..."". So the antibiotics were given for 3 days after the first surgery. The limited necrectomy was done after those 3 days. So the antibiotic therapy started at +1 (after surgery), lasted 3 days (72 hours), so the event of starting antibiotics is at +1, and the limited surgery is at +72.",
So:,
- empirical antibiotic therapy , +1
- limited necrectomy , +72
"Then, three days later (after the limited necrectomy), so +72 + 72 = +144, bacteriological testing done.",
"Then on postoperative day 7 (from the first surgery, which was at +1), day 7 is +1 + 7*24 = +169? Wait, no. If the first surgery was at +1 hour, then postoperative day 7 is 7 days after surgery, which is 7*24 = 168 hours after surgery, which is +1 + 168 = +169? Or is it 7 days after admission? The term ""postoperative day 7"" usually refers to days after the surgery. Since the surgery was at +1 hour, day 1 would be +24 hours after surgery, so day 7 would be +7*24 = 168 hours after surgery, which is +1 + 168 = +169 hours since admission. But the case report might be considering postoperative days as days starting from the surgery day. So day 7 would be +7*24 = 168 hours from surgery, which is +1 + 168 = 169. But maybe the case report is using ""postoperative day 7"" as the seventh day after the surgery, counting the day of surgery as day 0. In that case, day 7 would be 7*24 = 168 hours after surgery, so timestamp +1 + 168 = 169. Alternatively, if the surgery is considered day 1, then day 7 would be +6*24 = 144 hours after surgery, which would be +1 + 144 = 145. This is confusing. ",
"The case report says: ""On postoperative day 7, the patient’s entire face became edematous, and we performed necrectomy of the entire epicranial galea..."" So likely, this is 7 days after the first surgery, which was at +1 hour. So 7 days = 168 hours, so the event happens at +1 + 168 = 169 hours. But for simplicity, maybe the timestamp is rounded to +168, considering that the surgery was at +1 and day 7 is +168. Alternatively, maybe it's considered as 7 days after the surgery, so +168 hours from surgery time, which would be +169 from admission. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest is to take it as 7 days after the surgery, so +168 hours from surgery start, which is +1 + 168 = 169, but for simplicity, use +168.",
"But this might be overcomplicating. The case report might be referring to postoperative day 7 from the first surgery, which would be 7 days after the surgery, so 7*24=168 hours after the surgery. Since the surgery was at +1 hour, the event happens at +1 + 168 = 169. But since the exact timing isn't critical, maybe approximate to +168.",
"Similarly, postoperative day 45 would be 45 days after the surgery, which is 45*24=1080 hours. If the surgery was at +1, then the event is at +1080 +1 = 1081, but again, we can approximate to +1080.",
