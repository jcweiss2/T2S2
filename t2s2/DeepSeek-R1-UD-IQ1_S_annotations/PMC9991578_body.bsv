Alright, so I'm faced with this detailed medical case report, and I need to extract all the clinical events along with their respective timestamps in hours. The admission event is set at timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive ones. If a time isn't explicitly stated, I need to approximate based on surrounding info. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the case starts with a 37-year-old man admitted to the abdominal surgery department. His admission is at time 0. He presents with pain, an open postoperative wound in the left subcostal area, and multiple enterocutaneous fistulas with significant daily output. These are all at the time of admission, so their timestamps are 0.

Looking into his medical history, he had high-degree obesity (BMI 48 kg/m²) and multiple unsuccessful weight loss attempts. Since these are part of his history before admission, I need to figure out how far back. The case mentions he had bariatric surgery which included distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Braun anastomosis, and Shalimov plug. These surgeries likely occurred months before the current admission. The case report later mentions that after 5 months, he was transferred to the clinic. Assuming the initial bariatric surgery was 5 months prior, converting that to hours (5 months ≈ 150 days ≈ 3600 hours). But wait, in the events after admission, there's a transfer to the clinic on the 86th day from initial surgery. Wait, let me check the timeline.

The case report mentions multiple postoperative complications. On the 3rd and 17th postoperative days, there were emergency surgeries for adhesive small bowel obstruction. Then on the 21st day, gastroenteroanastomosic leakage occurred. Then on day 61, surgical fistula closure, followed by complications 3 days post that surgery (fever, bowel content in wound). Then day 71, another relaparotomy. Day 86, another surgery. After unsuccessful treatment, transferred to the clinic. Then 3 months of non-operative management before reconstructive surgery.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let me parse the timeline step by step.

The initial bariatric surgery (distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y, etc.) is the starting point. Then on postoperative days 3 and 17, emergency surgeries for adhesive obstruction. Each emergency surgery is a separate event. Then on day 21, gastroenteroanastomosic leakage and peritonitis. Then on day 61, surgical fistula closure, which failed, leading to complications. On day 71, another relaparotomy. Day 86, another surgery. Then transfer to the clinic. Then 3 months of non-operative care before reconstructive surgery.

The admission event mentioned at the beginning is when the patient is admitted to the abdominal surgery department with pain, open wound, and fistulas. This seems to be after the initial bariatric surgery and subsequent complications. So perhaps the admission in the case report is after the patient has already had multiple surgeries and complications, leading to his transfer to the clinic. Wait, the case report says: "After the unsuccessful surgical treatment, patient was transferred to our clinic." So the admission event at the beginning is the transfer to the clinic. Therefore, the initial bariatric surgery and subsequent complications leading up to the transfer are prior events with negative timestamps.

Let me reconstruct the timeline:

1. Initial bariatric surgery (distal gastrectomy, etc.): This occurred months before the current admission. Let's say the patient was transferred to the clinic on day 86 from the initial surgery. The transfer to the clinic is the admission event here (timestamp 0). Therefore, the initial surgery was 86 days before admission. 86 days * 24 hours = -2064 hours. Wait, but in the case report, after the unsuccessful surgeries, the patient was transferred to the clinic, which is the admission event. So prior events are relative to this admission.

Wait, the case report's timeline is a bit confusing. Let me clarify:

The patient's history includes the initial bariatric surgery (distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y, etc.). Then, on postoperative days 3 and 17, he had emergency surgeries for adhesive obstruction. Then on day 21 (4 days after last relaparotomy), gastroenteroanastomosic leakage. Then on day 61, surgical fistula closure. Three days post that (day 64), fever, bowel content in wound. Day 71, another relaparotomy. Day 86, another surgery. Then transferred to the clinic. So the admission to the clinic (current admission) is on day 86 from the initial surgery. Therefore, the initial surgery is at -86 days (-2064 hours), but since the admission is at 0, all events before that are negative.

However, the case report's "CASE REPORT" section starts with the patient being admitted to the abdominal surgery department with pain, open wound, etc. But later mentions that after unsuccessful surgeries, he was transferred to the clinic. So perhaps the initial admission (in the case report) is after the initial surgeries, and the transfer to the clinic is a later event. Wait, let me read carefully:

The case report says: "After the unsuccessful surgical treatment, patient was transferred to our clinic." So prior to that, the patient was in another hospital where the initial bariatric surgery and subsequent complications occurred. The transfer to the clinic is the admission event here, timestamp 0. Therefore, all events before the transfer are negative.

So the timeline prior to transfer:

- Initial bariatric surgery (distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y, Braun anastomosis, Shalimov plug): let's say this happened 5 months before transfer, but the case report mentions specific days:

Postoperative days 3, 17, 21, 61, 71, 86. Since the transfer happens on day 86 from the initial surgery, those days are all before the transfer. Therefore, converting days to hours before admission (0):

- Postoperative day 3: 3 days = 72 hours before transfer? No, wait. The initial surgery is day 0. Then on day 3, first emergency surgery. Day 17: another. Day 21: leakage. Day 61: fistula closure. Day 71: relaparotomy. Day 86: another surgery, then transfer. So each of these events happens on days 3, 17, 21, 61, 71, 86 after the initial surgery, but since the transfer to the clinic is on day 86, the time from the initial surgery to transfer is 86 days. Therefore, when the patient is transferred to the clinic (admission event, timestamp 0), the initial surgery was 86 days prior, which is -2064 hours.

But in the case report, when the patient is admitted to the clinic, he has an abdominal wound, fistulas, etc., which are the result of all the prior complications. Therefore, events like the initial bariatric surgery, adhesive obstructions, leakage, surgeries, etc., all occurred before this admission, so their timestamps are negative.

This is quite complex. Let's list the key events and their timing relative to the admission (transfer to clinic):

1. Initial bariatric surgery: 86 days before admission (-2064 hours)
2. Postoperative day 3: emergency surgery for adhesive obstruction (-2064 + 3*24 = -1992 hours)
3. Postoperative day 17: another emergency surgery (-2064 +17*24= -1584 hours)
4. Postoperative day 21: gastroenteroanastomosic leakage (-2064 +21*24= -1440 hours)
5. Postoperative day 61: surgical fistula closure (-2064 +61*24= -792 hours)
6. 3 days post that: fever, bowel content (-792 - 3*24= -864 hours)
7. Day 71: relaparotomy (-2064 +71*24= -456 hours)
8. Day 86: another surgery (-2064 +86*24= 0 hours? Wait, no. Transfer happens on day 86, so day 86 is the day of transfer. So the last surgery on day 86 would be just before transfer, maybe timestamp 0. But the case says "On the 86 day from the initial bariatric surgery, an emergency relaparatomy was performed... After the unsuccessful surgical treatment, patient was transferred to our clinic." So the surgery on day 86 is followed by transfer. So the transfer timestamp is 0, and the surgery on day 86 is at -0 hours (same day), but since the transfer is after that surgery, maybe the surgery is at -24 hours (the day before transfer). But this is unclear. Alternatively, the transfer occurs on day 86, so the surgery on day 86 is timestamp 0. But this complicates the timeline.

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps a better approach is to consider the admission event (transfer to the clinic) as timestamp 0, and all prior events are relative to that. The case report mentions that the patient was transferred after unsuccessful surgical treatment, which included multiple surgeries up to day 86. So the events leading up to the transfer are all negative.

Let's consider each event's timing based on the days mentioned in the case report relative to the initial surgery, then convert those days to hours before admission (transfer). Since the transfer happens on day 86, each event's day is subtracted by 86 days to get the time before admission.

Wait, no. If the initial surgery is day 0, and the transfer is on day 86, then the time between the initial surgery and transfer is 86 days. Therefore, each event's day count (e.g., day 3, 17, etc.) is days after the initial surgery, which is 86 days before transfer. Therefore, each event's timestamp is (day - 86) * 24 hours. For example:

D3: 3 - 86 = -83 days = -1992 hours
D17: 17 - 86 = -69 days = -1656 hours
D21: 21 - 86 = -65 days = -1560 hours
D61: 61 -86 = -25 days = -600 hours
D71: 71 -86 = -15 days = -360 hours
D86: 86 -86 = 0 days = 0 hours (but the transfer is after this, so maybe the surgery on D86 is at -24 hours?)

This is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the admission event (transfer) is timestamp 0, and all events prior are negative based on days from the initial surgery. The initial surgery is at -86 days (-2064 hours), and each subsequent event is relative to that. But the admission (transfer) is at day 86, so events after the initial surgery but before transfer are between -2064 and 0 hours.

This is too time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to list all events and their mentioned timing relative to the admission.

Looking back at the case report:

The patient is admitted to the clinic (transfer) after unsuccessful surgeries. At admission, he has an open wound, fistulas, etc. His history includes:

- High-degree obesity and weight loss attempts (prior to initial surgery)
0. Initial bariatric surgery (time T=-120 days? Not sure)

Then, postoperative complications:

1. On postoperative days 3 and 17: adhesive small bowel obstruction, emergency surgeries.
2. On day 21: gastroenteroanastomosic leakage, peritonitis.
3. On day 61: surgical fistula closure.
4. Three days post-op (day 64): fever, bowel content.
5. Day 71: relaparotomy.
6. Day 86: another surgery, then transfer to clinic (admission event).

Assuming that the transfer happens on day 86 after initial surgery, then:

- Initial surgery: -86 days = -2064 hours
@But when the patient is admitted to the clinic (transfer), that's timestamp 0. So events before that are negative.

Therefore:

- Initial bariatric surgery: -2064 hours
) On day 3: -2064 + 3*24 = -1992 hours
) On day 17: -2064 +17*24 = -1584 hours
) On day 21: -2064 +21*24 = -1440 hours
) On day 61: -2064 +61*24 = -792 hours
) Three days post day 61: day 64: -2064 +64*24 = -672 hours
) On day 71: -2064 +71*24 = -456 hours
