    Let's break down the events and their timestamps based on the case report:,
1. **Patient Demographics and Admission Events (Timestamp 0):**,
"   - The patient is a 31-year-old female with a history of chronic hypertension, SLE, and deep venous thrombosis. She presented to the emergency department with heavy vaginal bleeding 4 days postpartum. This sets the admission event at timestamp 0.",
2. **Historical Events (Negative Timestamps):**,
"   - Previous term pregnancies, postpartum transient ischemic attack, preterm pregnancy due to severe preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancy are noted. These events are part of her obstetric history and occurred before the current admission. The time ""4-day postpartum"" indicates the current event happened 4 days after delivery, but since the admission is at timestamp 0, the prior events are assigned a timestamp of -168 hours (7 days * 24 hours = 168 hours, but adjusted to 4 days postpartum would be -96 hours? However, the initial assignment was -168, which seems based on weeks mentioned in the case).",
3. **Emergency Department Evaluation (Timestamp 0):**,
"   - Tachycardia, hypotension, fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed on arrival. Initial labs showed hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dl and platelet count of 34,000/μL. Liver function, fibrinogen, and renal function were normal.",
4. **Initial Treatment (Timestamp 0):**,
"   - The patient received IV fluids, transfusions, antibiotics. Enoxaparin and hydroxychloroquine were discontinued. She was admitted to the ICU, underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade, which stopped the bleeding and improved her hemodynamics.",
5. **Subsequent Hospital Days (Positive Timestamps):**,
"   - By hospital day 3 (72 hours), her platelet count dropped to 17,000/μL, and anemia persisted despite transfusions. Schistocytes were present, but other hemolytic markers were normal.",
"   - On hospital day 5 (120 hours), she developed aphasia and altered mental status, which resolved. The multidisciplinary team decided to start PLEX.",
"   - PLEX began on day 6 (144 hours), leading to clinical improvement. However, thrombocytopenia was refractory, leading to additional treatments starting on days 14, 18, and 22 (336, 432, 528 hours respectively).",
"   - She was discharged to rehabilitation after improvement, timestamped at 1008 hours (42 days).",
**Key Considerations:**,
"![""The time during pregnancy with greatest risk for the development of TTP is near term and during the postpartum period."" indicates that the onset of TTP in this case is around the postpartum period, which aligns with the 4-day postpartum presentation.] The timestamps are calculated based on the hospital days mentioned (each day is 24 hours). Events on day 3 are at 72 hours, day 5 at 120 hours, etc. The initial events in the emergency department are at 0, and subsequent days increment the timestamp accordingly.",
"It's essential to ensure that events like discontinuation of medications, procedures, and symptom resolution are timestamped relative to the admission. The autoimmune panel evaluation on day 3 is at 72 hours, and PLEX initiation on day 6 is at 144 hours. The refractory thrombocytopenia and subsequent treatments are timestamped based on the hospital day progression.",
"However, there might be inconsistencies in the initial assignment of historical events. For example, ""4-day postpartum"" would be -96 hours (4 days * 24), but the prior term pregnancies and other obstetric history are assigned -168 hours (7 days before), which might be inferred from the case's mention of ""previous episodes"" and ""most recent pregnancy."" The exact timing of historical events can be challenging without explicit timelines, so approximations based on clinical context are used.",
"Overall, the timestamps reflect the progression of hospital days and the relative timing of each event post-admission.",
