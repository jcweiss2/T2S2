"Alright, let's dive into this case. The patient is a 55-year-old male with an 8-month history of severe watery diarrhea, presenting to the hospital. The key here is to extract all clinical events and assign timestamps relative to admission (timestamp 0).",
"First, the main admission event is at timestamp 0. The 8-month history of diarrhea translates to 8 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day = 5760 hours before admission, so timestamp -5760. The colonoscopy 3 days prior is 3*24=72 hours before admission, so -72.",
"On admission, all initial assessments (lethargy, dehydration, lab results) are at 0. The ICU admission, rehydration, and parenteral nutrition start at 0. The CT scan showing the pancreatic mass and liver metastases is during admission, so timestamp 0. The biopsy results, hormone profiles, and initiation of octreotide are also at 0.",
"Subsequent events like sepsis, ultrafiltration, renal improvement, discharge after 12 days (12*24=288 hours), and follow-up plans are post-admission, so positive timestamps. Negative findings (no rash, no nausea) are included at 0.",
"I need to ensure all events are captured, split into components (e.g., diarrhea and bowel frequency), and assign correct timestamps based on the narrative. Also, include all pertinent negatives mentioned in the discussion.",
