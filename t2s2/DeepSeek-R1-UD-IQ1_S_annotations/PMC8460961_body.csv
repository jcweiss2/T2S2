"    The assistant's response starts by extracting the key events from the case report and assigning timestamps. The admission event (presented to the emergency center) is assigned a timestamp of 0. The patient's history of sacral myofibroblastic sarcoma and related surgeries occurred two weeks prior to presentation, which translates to -336 hours (14 days * 24 hours/day = 336 hours). Events during admission, such as the development of seizures, administration of medications, and diagnostic procedures like lumbar puncture and imaging, are assigned timestamps relative to the admission time (0). Subsequent events, like MRI findings one day after admission, are timestamped at +24 hours. The discharge on day 16 is +384 hours (16 days * 24). Each event is separated into individual components, and conjunctive phrases are split into separate events with the same timestamp. Pertinent negatives (e.g., no cardiac abnormalities) are included. The assistant ensures all events are captured, including treatments, diagnostic findings, and outcomes, using clinical judgment where explicit temporal information is missing.",
