Visual Studio Test Platform
============================

This repository contains the code for the Visual Studio Test Platform. The platform is used for running tests, discovery, execution, reporting and, more. This repo contains the code for the core libraries, the test framework, and the test runner.

Visual Studio Test Platform consists of the following components:
- **[Test Framework](src/testhost)**: Test Framework contains code for writing tests. It is the SDK of the platform. The framework is built using managed code and currently supports writing tests in C#, VB and F#. The framework also supports authoring tests in C++/CLI. The framework supports writing unit tests, functional tests, data driven tests, all the way up to unit tests with large test infrastructure.
- **[Test Runner](src/vstest)**: The test runner is a console application that can be used to run tests. The runner can be used to run tests in a solution, a project or a dll. The runner supports running tests using a test framework. The runner is built using managed code and can be run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The runner can also be used to run tests in a CI/CD pipeline.
- **[Test Platform](src/Microsoft.TestPlatform)**: The Test Platform is the core of the platform. It is the engine that is responsible for discovering, running, and reporting tests. The platform is built using managed code and can be run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The platform is extensible and can be used to run tests using any test framework. The platform is also extensible and can be used to run tests in any environment. The platform is also extensible and can be used to run tests using any test runner. The platform is also extensible and can be used to run tests using any test reporting format. The platform is also extensible and can be used to run tests using any test reporting tool.
