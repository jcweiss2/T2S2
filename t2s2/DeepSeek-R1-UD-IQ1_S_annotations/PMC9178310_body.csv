"Alright, let me break down how I approached this problem. First, I need to extract all clinical events from the case report and assign timestamps based on their occurrence relative to the admission event, which is at time 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive timestamps. The unit is hours, but we omit it in the output.",
"I start by reading the case report carefully. The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a 3-day history of chest pain. She presented to the emergency room with dyspnea, which is the admission event. So, ""presented to emergency room"" is at 0. The chest pain started 3 days before, which is 72 hours, so it's -72.",
"Next, her medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia. These are ongoing conditions, so they're at 0. The elevated troponin T level and ST depression on ECG were part of the initial presentation, so also 0. The pulmonary congestion and severe mitral regurgitation with P2 prolapse were found during admission, so they're 0.",
"The coronary angiography showing 99% stenosis of the left circumflex artery is part of the admission workup, so 0. Procedures like intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) initiation and intubation in the ICU happened at admission, so 0. The diagnosis of AMR with PMR as a complication of AMI was made during admission, so 0.",
"Cardiogenic shock developed around admission time, so 0. Hemodynamics managed with IABP and inotropes are part of the initial treatment, so 0. The emergency PCI and MVR via minithoracotomy were done during the admission period, so their timestamps are 0.",
"Postoperative events: IABP was discontinued the day after the procedure, which is +24 hours. Extubation happened 2 days postoperatively, which is +48 hours. Sepsis developed 4 days postoperatively, so +96 hours. The source was a rectal ulcer, also at +96. After antibacterial treatment, she was discharged from the ICU 6 days postoperatively, which is +144 hours.",
"Finally, upon discharge, she could walk 200m and was transferred, which are at discharge time, so 0. I made sure to separate composite phrases into individual events and assign the same timestamp. For events without explicit timing, I used clinical context to place them around admission (0) or based on post-op days converted to hours.",
