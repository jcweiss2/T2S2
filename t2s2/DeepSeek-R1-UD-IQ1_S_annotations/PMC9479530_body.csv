"Alright, so I need to create a table of clinical events with timestamps based on this case report. Let me start by reading through the case carefully and noting all the events mentioned along with their timing. ",
"First, the patient is a 65-year-old male with underlying conditions: allergic rhinitis, eczema, dyslipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presented with left eye blurring of vision that started 3 years ago. The admission event is timestamp 0. ",
"He was admitted for TSH and tumor excision. The procedure happened uneventfully, so that's part of the admission timestamp 0. Postoperatively, on day 1, he developed polyuria and was treated for cranial diabetes insipidus with desmopressin. Day 1 would be 24 hours, so that's +24.",
"On day 7, he became febrile, tachypneic, tachycardic, had minimal cough, and other symptoms. Day 7 is 168 hours, so those events are +168. The same day, he started on IV Tazosin. Also, he complained of headache and neck pain on the same day (day 7), so that's +168.",
"On day 9 (216 hours), his Glasgow Coma Scale dropped, he had neck stiffness, positive Kernig’s and Brudzenski signs, increased WBC, CRP, and blood culture came back positive for E. meningoseptica. He was intubated and transferred to neurocritical care, started on Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin. Lumbar puncture done on day 9 (216 hours) showed CSF findings. Bacteremia and meningitis diagnosed here.",
"Then, on day 13 (312 hours), the contrast-enhanced CT showed sinus thrombosis, leading to SC clexane. Tracheal aspirate grew Acinetobacter, so IV Polymyxin was added. ",
"Antibiotics completed after 14 days, so day 14 (336 hours). Extubation on day 17 (408 hours). Finally, discharge after recovery.",
"I need to list all events, including negatives like no papilloedema, and separate conjunctive phrases. For the vision blurring, since it's a 3-year history, but the admission is at 0, I'll approximate. However, the case mentions the vision blurring started 3 years ago but progressively worsened, leading to admission. Since it's a long-term issue before admission, I'll assign a negative timestamp. But since the exact timing isn't given, perhaps use an approximation based on when symptoms led to admission. The case says he presented with insidious onset over the past 3 years, which is a long time. Since the admission is at 0, and the onset was 3 years prior, but we need to convert to hours. 3 years is about 26280 hours, but since the exact time isn't specified, maybe the event leading to admission (the worsening) is closer to admission. However, the problem states if no temporal info, use approximation based on events before/after. Since the vision issue started 3 years ago, but the admission was for TSH due to the macroadenoma, maybe the vision blurring is part of the reason for admission, so timestamp 0? Hmm, the initial presentation was with left eye blurring over 3 years, which led to the MRI and eventual admission. So the blurring started 3 years before admission, which would be a negative timestamp. But in the example given in the system prompt, the fever and rash with a 3-day history were assigned -72 (3 days = 72 hours). So applying that logic, 3 years is much longer, but since the case report doesn't specify how long before admission the symptoms worsened, perhaps the 3-year history is considered part of the admission reason, so maybe timestamp 0. Wait, but in the example, the 3-day history was assigned -72 because it was before admission. Similarly, the left eye blurring over 3 years is a history before admission, so it should be a negative timestamp. 3 years is approximately 26280 hours (3*365*24). So the left eye blurring would be -26280. But in the system's example, the acne was four weeks ago, which is -672. So perhaps for this case, the left eye blurring started 3 years ago, so -26280. However, the problem says if no temporal info, use approximation based on surrounding events. But the admission is for the tumor excision, which was scheduled due to the vision issues. So the vision problem led to the admission, but the onset was 3 years prior. Since the exact timing of when the symptoms became severe enough to warrant surgery isn't specified, but the admission is timestamp 0, perhaps the vision blurring is a pre-admission event with a very negative timestamp. However, the instructions say to use approximation if necessary, but the example used exact times when possible. Since the case says ""initially presented with insidious onset of the left eye blurring of vision over the past 3 years which progressively worsened,"" the 3 years is the duration before admission. So the event of left eye blurring started 3 years before admission, so timestamp -26280. But since the instructions say to use hours and omit units, that's a very large number. However, maybe the problem expects to ignore very long durations and consider only events closer to admission. Alternatively, perhaps the admission is for the surgery, and the vision blurring is part of the reason for the surgery, so considered part of the admission process, thus timestamp 0. ",
"This is a bit unclear. Looking back at the example provided by the system: the four weeks ago events (acne diagnosis and treatment) were assigned -672 (4 weeks * 7 days * 24 hours = 672). Similarly, the 3-day history of fever and rash was assigned -72 (3 days * 24 = 72). So following that pattern, the 3-year history would be 3*365*24=26280 hours before admission, so timestamp -26280. However, in the system's example, events with a history before admission are assigned negative timestamps based on the duration mentioned. Therefore, in this case, the left eye blurring of vision over the past 3 years would be timestamp -26280. ",
"Other events: On day 1 post-op (24 hours), polyuria and treatment with desmopressin. On day 7 (168 hours), febrile, tachypneic, etc. Same day, IV Tazosin started. Day 7 headache and neck pain. Day 9 (216 hours): GCS drop, signs, blood culture results, intubation, antibiotics. Lumbar puncture on day 9. Day 13 (312 hours): CT scan, sinus thrombosis, SC clexane, tracheal aspirate culture. Antibiotics completed on day 14 (336 hours). Extubation on day 17 (408). Discharge after that.",
"Also, include negative findings: no papilloedema, no neurological deficit, no CSF rhinorrhea, no adventitious sounds, etc. These are part of the admission exam, so timestamp 0.",
So compiling all events:,
"- Demographic info: 65 years old, male – timestamp 0.",
"B Underlying conditions: allergic rhinitis, eczema, dyslipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia – timestamp 0.",
- Left eye blurring of vision: -26280.,
"- Left visual field quadrantanopia: found on exam at admission, so 0.",
"no papilloedema and ""no other neurological deficit"" – part of admission exam, 0.",
"MRI findings (pituitary macroadenoma) – part of pre-admission workup, but since the admission is for surgery, maybe timestamp 0? Or is the MRI done before admission? The case says ""MRI brain reported..."" before admission, so the MRI was done prior, but the exact timing isn't clear. Since the admission was for TSH, the MRI was part of the pre-admission evaluation. If the MRI was done before admission, then the timestamp would be negative. However, the problem states to use approximation if temporal info isn't available. Since the MRI led to the admission, perhaps it's considered part of the admission process, so timestamp 0. Alternatively, if it's done weeks before, it would be a negative timestamp. But without specific timing, perhaps assign 0.",
"Similarly, neuroendocrine workup showing low cortisol, etc., done pre-admission, but timestamp 0 as part of admission process.",
TSH and excision – timestamp 0 as it's the reason for admission.,
"Post-op events: polyuria on day 1 (24), desmopressin started (24). ",
"Day 7 events: febrile, tachypneic, tachycardic, minimal cough, no neuro symptoms, no CSF rhinorrhea, equal air entry, no adventitious sounds, chest X-ray findings, WBC and CRP results, IV Tazosin started, headache, neck pain, indecisive about lumbar puncture – all at 168.",
"Day 9: GCS drop, pupils reactive, neck stiffness, Kernig’s and Brudzenski signs, increased WBC and CRP, blood culture results, intubation, transfer to NCCU, Meropenem and Cipro started – 216.",
"Lumbar puncture on day 9: CSF results, culture positive – 216.",
Diagnosis of bacteremia and meningitis – 216.,
"Day 13: CT scan showing thrombosis, SC clexane, tracheal aspirate culture – 312.",
Antibiotics completed on day 14: 336.,
Extubation on day 17: 408.,
"Repeated CTV resolving – 336? Since day 14 is completion of antibiotics, but the CTV was done after, perhaps day 14? Or later. The case says ""repeated CTV Brain, the venous sinus thrombosis was resolving."" Timing isn't specified, but after starting clexane on day 13, so maybe day 14 or later. Since the exact time isn't given, but after day 13, perhaps assign 312 + 24 = 336. ",
"Septic parameters normalized (WBC 7000, CRP negative) – timestamp?",
"The patient was seen in follow-up after discharge, which is post discharge, so beyond the timeline here.",
"Putting it all together, the events and timestamps would be as listed in the assistant's answer. Each event is separated into components, and timestamps are assigned based on the day mentioned converted to hours (day 1 = 24, day 7 = 168, etc.). Negative timestamps for pre-admission events with known durations (like the 3-year vision blurring as -26280). Underlying conditions and admission-related events at 0.",
