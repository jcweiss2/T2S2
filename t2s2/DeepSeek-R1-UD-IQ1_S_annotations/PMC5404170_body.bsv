    Here's how I approached creating the event timeline:

1. Admission event (medical history checks) at time 0
2. Injury and initial treatment happened 36 hours before slab removal (-48h from admission)
3. Symptoms after 36h of plaster placed at -12h (since admission was day 0)
4. Referral to tertiary center on day 3 (+24h)
5. Subsequent procedures and treatments timed based on days after admission
6. Death on day 20 (20*24=480h)

I separated composite symptoms into individual events and ensured all reported events were included with estimated timestamps based on the narrative flow.
