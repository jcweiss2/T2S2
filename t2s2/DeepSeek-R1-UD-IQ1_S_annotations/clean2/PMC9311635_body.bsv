Alternatively, the user's example had 'fever and rash | -72' for a 3-day history (72 hours). In this case, perhaps the events before admission (seizures, vaping, talking) happened "upon arrival" so they are at 0. Wait, no. The patient was vaping and talking when the seizures started, which led to EMS being called. So the time sequence is:
- seizures | -2
- vaping and talking | -2
- seizures | -24 (assuming the onset was a day before, but no, the case says "new onset of seizures" upon presentation. The EMS was called when he was found seizing, so perhaps the entire event from seizure onset to ED arrival is within a few hours. So:
