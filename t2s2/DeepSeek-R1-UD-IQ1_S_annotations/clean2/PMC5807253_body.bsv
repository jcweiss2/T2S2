Pressors discontinued on day 4 (96 hours), extubated on day 6 (144), metformin level back on day 7 (168), ICU discharge on day 9 (216), hospital discharge on day 15 (360). Dialysis discontinued within a month post-discharge, so that's after hospital discharge, timestamp 360 + (up to 720), but the assistant uses -720. Wait, the assistant's entry has "dialysis discontinued | -720", which doesn't make sense because discontinuation happened after discharge. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, the serum creatinine two months prior was 0.86, which is -1440 hours (2 months â‰ˆ 8 weeks, 8*7*24=1344, but 2 months is approx 8.67 weeks, so 1440 hours). So that's timestamp -1440.
