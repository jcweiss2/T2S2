Follow-up: no events after 18 months (18*30*24=12960 hours, but the case says 18 months, which is 13140 hours (18*730 hours per month). Wait, 18 months is 18*30 days=540 days, which is 12960 hours. However, 18 months is actually 18*12 months, each month approx 730 hours (24*30.44). So 18*730=13140 hours). The CT imaging every 3 months is part of follow-up, starting after discharge, so timestamp 696 (discharge) plus time, but since the case report mentions "until now, he has not had any events after 18 months and is followed with CT imaging every 3 months..." So the 18 months is after discharge. Since discharge is at 696 hours (29 days), the 18 months would be 18*730=13140 hours after admission. But since the discharge is at 696, the follow-up events are after that, but the timestamp is relative to admission. So the 18 months post-discharge would be 696 + (18*730) = but the instruction says to use the admission as 0, so all events after admission have positive timestamps. So the 18 months after discharge would actually be 29 days (696 hours) plus 18 months. Wait, but the case says "discharged without major postoperative complications on POD 29. Until now, he has not had any events after 18 months and is followed with CT imaging every 3 months..." So the 18 months is after discharge. Since discharge is at 696 hours (29 days), the 18 months would be 18*730=13140 hours after discharge. But the total time from admission would be 696 + 13140 = 13836 hours. However, the instruction says timestamps are relative to admission. So "until now" is after discharge, but how is that handled? The instruction says: "the events happened before event with 0 timestamp have negative time, the ones after the event with 0 timestamp have positive time." So discharge is at 24 hours in the example. In this case, discharge is at 696 hours. Events after discharge would have timestamps beyond 696. However, in the case report, "until now, he has not had any events after 18 months" from discharge. Since the admission is the reference point (0), the 18 months after discharge would be 696 + 13140 = 13836 hours. But the instruction says that for events without specific time, use approximation. Since the case report states "after 18 months" from discharge, the time from admission would be 29 days (696 hours) plus 18 months (13140 hours) totaling 13836 hours. However, the instruction might consider the 18 months as a duration after discharge, but since the reference is admission, perhaps the 18 months is just considered as a future event timestamp. However, the user instruction example includes "discharged | 24". So in that example, discharge happened 24 hours after admission. In this case, discharge is at 29 days post-op, which is 696 hours (29*24). So the discharge event is timestamp 696.
