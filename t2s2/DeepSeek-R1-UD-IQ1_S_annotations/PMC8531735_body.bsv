Alright, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event has a timestamp of 0. Events before admission have negative times, and those after have positive times. The timestamps are in hours. If no temporal info is available, I'll approximate based on context.

First, let's read the case report. The patient is a 48-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department with left breast enlargement and black discoloration for 1 year. She had a history of fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. She has diabetes and hypertension. No history of lymphoma or breast implants, no family history of breast cancer or lymphoma.

On examination, her left breast was swollen with dark discoloration, multiple ulcers, nipple retracted, tender, warm, firm. Left axillary lymph node palpable. Labs showed leukocytosis, prolonged coagulation, MRSA in wound and blood. No radiological studies done. Emergency surgery with mastectomy. She died 2 days post-op due to DIC and septicemia.

Pathology confirmed PB?ALCL, giant cell-rich pattern, with various immunohistochemistry findings.

So, the admission event (presenting to ED) is at 0. The symptoms she presented with (breast enlargement, discoloration) started 1 year ago, which is 8760 hours (1 year = 8760 hours). The history of fever, loss of appetite, weight loss would be same as the 1-year duration, so also -8760.

Her chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension) are long-standing, so assign same as other history, -8760.

On admission, the physical exam findings (swollen breast, discoloration, ulcers, nipple retraction, tenderness, warmth, firmness, lymph node) are at 0.

Lab results at admission: leukocytosis, coagulation issues, MRSA culturesâ€”timestamp 0.

Emergency surgery and mastectomy done during admission, so timestamp 0.

She died 2 days after surgery, which is 48 hours (2 days = 48 hours). DIC and septicemia at time of death, so +48.

Diagnosis of PB?ALCL made during admission, so timestamp 0.

All the immunohistochemistry results (CD30+, CD45+, etc.) are part of the diagnostic process, so timestamp 0.

Negative findings (no previous lymphoma, no implants, no family history) are part of history, so timestamp 0. No radiological studies done during admission, timestamp 0.

Pathology findings (no epidermotropism, uninvolved breast tissue) are part of the exam, so 0.

Death and autopsy not performed are at +48.

I need to list all events, splitting conjunctive phrases into separate events. For example, "left breast enlargement and black discoloration" become two separate events with same timestamp.

Make sure to include all events, even negative findings like "no family history."

So creating the table with events and timestamps separated by |.
