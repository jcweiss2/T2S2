    Here's the step-by-step explanation:

    1. **Admission Event**: The patient is admitted to the clinic for cardiac evaluation, which is the reference point (timestamp 0).

    2. **Symptoms Before Admission**: The increasing dyspnoea and edema of the lower limbs are mentioned as the reason for admission. Since these symptoms led to the admission, they are assigned a timestamp of -72 hours (assuming a 3-day history before admission).

    3. **Diagnostic Findings**: Elevated NT-proBNP, right axis deviation, and right atrial enlargement are detected during the initial evaluation at admission, so their timestamp is 0.

    4. **Medical History**: The patient's history of carcinoid tumor and metastases, along with prior treatments (partial ileum resection, somatostatin analogue), are considered to have occurred in the past. Assuming these events happened several weeks prior, a timestamp of -672 hours (4 weeks) is assigned.

    5. **Imaging Results**: Severe pulmonary stenosis, torrential tricuspid regurgitation, and related findings (coaptation defect, valve leaflet thickening/retraction) are identified during the admission evaluation, so timestamp 0.

    6. **Surgical Intervention**: The surgical valve replacement occurs after the evaluation. Assuming the surgery happens 1 day post-admission, timestamp 24 hours.

    7. **Postoperative Course**: The surgery and initial recovery are uneventful, also at 24 hours. The condition worsening occurs 2 days post-admission (48 hours). Exclusions of cardiac complications and carcinoid crises are part of the deterioration phase, timestamp 48.

    8. **Sepsis and Treatment**: Pneumogenic sepsis is identified as the cause at 48 hours. Treatment measures are initiated at this time.

    9. **Outcome**: The patient dies due to multi-organ failure, timestamp 72 hours (3 days post-admission).

    Each event is assigned based on its relation to the admission time (0), using clinical reasoning for approximation where explicit times are not provided.
