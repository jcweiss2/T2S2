Alright, let's tackle this case report step by step. The patient is a 47-year-old man presenting to the hospital with symptoms of COVID-19. The key events need to be extracted with their timestamps. 

First, the admission event is at time 0. The symptoms started 2 days before admission, so that's -48 hours. These symptoms include fever, sweats, cough, and shortness of breath. The diagnosis is confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab at admission, so that's 0. The chest X-ray showing right basal atelectasis is done on admission, so 0.

He was hospitalized for 3 weeks, which is 504 hours. During the inpatient stay, he required 2 days of ventilatory support (CPAP), which started after admission. Assuming the support started on the same day as admission, that would be 72 hours. The use of dexamethasone is part of the treatment during admission, so timestamp 0. Discharge occurs after 3 weeks, which is +504 hours.

Two weeks after discharge (which is 336 hours after admission), he returns with chest pain and shortness of breath. At this point, COVID-19 tests are negative. The CTPA shows hydropneumothorax and other findings, all at +336 hours. The interventions like antibiotics and drain insertion happen here. The drain fails, leading to surgery 6 weeks after initial presentation (6 weeks is 1008 hours).

The surgery includes thoracoscopy and lobectomy, all at +1008. Post-surgery events like antibiotic continuation, lab results, tachycardia resolution, and discharge-related events are at +1008. The macroscopic and microscopic evaluations are post-surgery, so +1008.

I need to make sure each event is separated and timestamped correctly. For example, symptoms before admission are negative times, interventions during admission at 0, and subsequent events after admission as positive times. Any event without explicit timing is approximated based on context.

Here is the extracted clinical events and their timestamps in the requested format:
