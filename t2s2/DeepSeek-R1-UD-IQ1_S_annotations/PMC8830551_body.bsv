Alright, I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is at timestamp 0. If there's no specific time mentioned, I'll use clinical judgment to assign a timestamp. Events before admission have negative hours, and after have positive. I need to split conjunctive phrases into individual events with the same timestamp. Also, include all events, even if they're in the discussion, and don't omit any. Pertinent negatives should be included too.

First, the case mentions an 18-year-old male admitted with a 3-day history of fever and rash. The admission is timestamp 0. The 3-day history translates to 72 hours before admission, so fever and rash are at -72. Then, four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and started minocycline. Four weeks is 672 hours, so those events are at -672. 

At admission, he had increased WBC count, eosinophilia, systemic involvement, diffuse erythematous eruption, and pruritusâ€”all at 0. The DRESS syndrome diagnosis is made around admission, so timestamp 0. The fever and rash persisted through admission, so those are also 0. He was discharged one day later, which is +24 hours.

I need to split "fever and rash" into separate events but same timestamp. Also, check if any other events are mentioned. The case doesn't mention other symptoms like denial of chest pain, so I don't include negatives here. Each event is listed with its timestamp, using approximations where necessary. I think I've covered all events mentioned. Now, format them in rows with events and timestamps separated by a pipe.
