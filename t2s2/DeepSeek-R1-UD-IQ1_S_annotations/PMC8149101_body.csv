"Alright, let's tackle this case report step by step. The goal is to extract all clinical events and assign them the correct timestamps based on the information provided. The admission event is at time 0, and anything before that is negative, anything after is positive. If no time is given, I'll need to use clinical judgment to approximate.",
"First, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. These are chronic conditions, so their timestamp is 0 as they are present on admission.",
"She sought the emergency department due to a 2-day history of symptoms. Since admission is at 0, seeking the ED was 48 hours before, so that's -48. The rash started two days ago, so that's also -48. The rash locations (thighs, armpits, inframammary fold) and progression to the whole body are part of the same event, so they get -48.",
"She used tampons two days before arrival, which would be -72 hours (2 days is 48 hours, so -48 - 24 = -72). The application of dexamethasone after rash onset would be around the same time as the rash, so -48.",
"On admission, her vital signs: hypotensive, BP 65/42, HR 113, febrile, somnolent, and the physical findings (morbilliform rash, pustular lesions) are all at time 0.",
"Diagnoses considered (septic shock, toxic shock, DRESS, AGEP) and treatments started (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, clindamycin, vasopressors) are at admission, so 0.",
"Lab results on admission (leukocytosis, neutrophilia, WBC count, kidney failure markers, bilirubin, transaminases, metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, chest x-ray findings, PCR positive for COVID) are all at 0.",
"During hospitalization, 1 day later, her kidney failure worsened. Since admission is day 0, 24 hours later would be +24. Vancomycin was discontinued and replaced with daptomycin at this time. Elevated creatine phosphokinase and concerns about rhabdomyolysis or deep tissue involvement also at +24. Skin biopsy performed here, and results (diffuse spongiosis, pustules, neutrophilic content, vascular changes) leading to AGEP diagnosis at +24.",
"Differential diagnoses (toxic shock, DRESS, septic shock, pustular psoriasis) reconsidered post-biopsy, but since biopsy was at +24, these considerations are also at +24.",
"She required vasopressors and corticosteroids from admission onwards (0). The 10-day antibiotic course would end around day 10, which is 240 hours. Local skin management started at 0.",
"Progressive improvement in hemodynamics and skin lesions likely started after initial treatment, so around +24. Stopping vasopressors and extubation after day 5 (120 hours). Recovery of kidney and liver functions around the same time. Chest CT findings at +120. Polyneuropathy and weakness developed around +120, resolved at day 14 (336 hours). Discharge at 336 hours.",
"I need to make sure all events are captured, split conjunctive phrases, and assign timestamps accurately. Some events might require estimation based on context. For instance, the tampon use was two days before arrival, so arrival is -48, two days before that is -72. The application of dexamethasone after rash onset is around the same time as the rash (-48). The 10-day antibiotic course ends at 240 hours (10 days * 24 hours = 240). Critical polyneuropathy resolved with rehab by discharge, which is at 336 hours (14 days).",
"Alright, let me check if I missed any events. The patient's prior medications (aspirin, losartan, atorvastatin) are part of her history, so they're at 0. The diagnosis of AGEP was confirmed after biopsy, so at +24. All the lab results and imaging on admission are at 0. The desquamation and resolution of skin lesions during treatment would be part of the progressive improvement, so timestamped at +24. Complications like polyneuropathy are during the stay, so +120. Discharge at +336.",
"I think that covers all events. Now, format them into two columns separated by a pipe, omitting the table title.",
