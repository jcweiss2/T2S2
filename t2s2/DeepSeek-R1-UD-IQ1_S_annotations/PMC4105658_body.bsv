Here is the step-by-step explanation for creating the clinical event timeline:

1. **Admission and Initial Diagnosis**:
   - The patient is admitted with acute pancreatitis, which is the starting point (time 0).
   - All events during admission (lab tests, imaging, diagnosis) are assigned timestamp 0.

2. **Surgical Procedure**:
   - The pancreatoduodenectomy is performed post-admission, so it's at time 0.
   - Perioperative events like blood loss and antibiotic administration are also at 0.

3. **Postoperative Days**:
   - Events on specific postoperative days are converted to hours (day 5 = 120 hours, day 6 = 144 hours, etc.).
   - Nutrition starts on day 5 (120), drain removal on day 6 (144), discharge on day 11 (264).

4. **Complications and Interventions**:
   - Symptoms on day 18 (432 hours) include pain, chills, melena, leading to emergency room visit.
   - Diagnostic procedures (CT, angiography) and treatments (stent graft) occur at the same timestamp (432).

5. **Follow-up and Long-term Care**:
   - Post-discharge follow-up and treatments (radiochemotherapy) are assigned timestamps based on their occurrence after discharge.

This approach ensures all clinical events are chronologically ordered with accurate timestamps.
