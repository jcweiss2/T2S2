"Alright, let's tackle this case report. The user wants me to extract all clinical events and assign timestamps relative to the admission event, which is timestamp 0. The timestamps should be in hours, and events before admission have negative times, while those after are positive. If there's no explicit time info, I need to estimate based on context.",
"First, I'll read through the case report carefully. The patient is a Saudi infant with neonatal cholestasis and a pathogenic NOTCH2 gene variant. Let's break down the events chronologically.",
The infant was delivered by emergency cesarean at 31 weeks due to abruptio placenta. The birth weight was 1090g. Apgar scores were 4 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes. There were two previous stillbirths in the family. The mother had hypothyroidism treated with thyroxine and gestational diabetes. She also had a group B streptococcal urinary infection treated with antibiotics. The parents weren't relatives. The patient had a 5-year-old sibling in good health. No significant family history of cholestasis or jaundice.,
"After birth, the infant had respiratory distress with a rate of 65/min, chest retractions, and was put on CPAP. Admitted to NICU. Physical exam showed cloudy eyes, ectropion, ichthyotic skin, undescended testes. No dysmorphia. Percentiles for height, weight, head circumference. Vitals: temp 36.2Â°C, heart rate 167 bpm. Initial labs were normal except for respiratory acidosis and ground-glass opacity on X-ray, leading to ARDS diagnosis. Surfactant given, CPAP continued. Bowel movement at 12 hours old.",
"On day 3, trophic feeding with breast milk started. Weaned from 40% to 21% FIO2 over weeks. On day 6, abdominal distension, tachycardia, tachypnea, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, CRP 70 mg/L. Antibiotics escalated to meropenem and vancomycin. Feeding stopped due to distension. After 72h, antibiotics stopped (cultures negative), feeding restarted at 30 mL/kg/day. In week 2, weaned to high-flow oxygen.",
"Weeks 3-4 had unexplained apnea episodes requiring CPAP. Septic workups negative. Brain MRI normal. Nasogastric tube feeding, some breast milk. No pale stools. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted since week 3 (total bilirubin 69.8 umol/L). Neonatologist initiated cholestasis workup. Pediatric gastroenterology suspected TPN-associated cholestasis. Adjusted feeding and TPN, no improvement. Genetic studies ordered for PFIC and ALGS. X-ray, echo, eye exam normal. Skull X-ray showed craniosynostosis. Abdominal US normal, no biliary atresia.",
"Albumin levels dropping, bilirubin, AST, ALT rising. Albumin infusions given. Ursodeoxycholic acid 30 mg/kg/day started but no improvement. Infectious workup negative. TSH, T3, T4, cortisol normal. Metabolic screens (galactosemia, tyrosinemia) negative. No micropenis. Whole exome sequencing sent at 8 weeks. Recurrent apnea treated with caffeine, phenobarbitone. At week 13, severe cyanosis, apnea, bradycardia, required resuscitation. Intubation, mechanical ventilation, epinephrine. Septic shock, DIC, acute renal injury, capillary leak. CRP 223.3 mg/L. Inotropic support, HFOV, nitric oxide. Died after 100 days due to Enterobacter cloacae sepsis. Postmortem genetic results showed NOTCH2 mutation (c.1076c>T).",
"Now, assigning timestamps. Admission to NICU is time 0. Events before admission (like birth, maternal conditions) have negative times. After admission, positive.",
Key events:,
"- Birth (emergency cesarean at 31 weeks): Since admission is at birth, but in this case, the infant was admitted to NICU immediately after birth. So birth and admission are at time 0.",
"- Maternal hypothyroidism, gestational diabetes, group B strep infection: These occurred before birth, so prior to admission. But the case report doesn't specify how long before, so might be part of the prenatal history. Since the mother was treated with thyroxine and antibiotics, but timing isn't clear. Maybe assign these to -672 (4 weeks prior) but not sure. The report mentions two previous stillbirths, but timing isn't given. Maybe these are prenatal and considered before birth, so time -672? Not clear. The user instruction says if no temporal info, approximate using context. Since the mother's conditions were ongoing during pregnancy, perhaps consider them at -672 (4 weeks) but not certain.",
"- Respiratory distress at birth: part of admission, so 0.",
; Events after admission:,
"- Trophic feeding on day 3: 3 days = 72 hours, so +72.",
