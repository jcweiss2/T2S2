**Explanation:**

The task is to extract clinical events and their timestamps from a case report. The admission event is timestamp 0, and other events are timestamped relative to admission. The physician must use clinical judgment to approximate timestamps when necessary. Here's the breakdown:

- **Demographics**: The patient's age (6 years old) and gender (male) are assigned timestamp 0.
  
4. **Symptoms Before Admission**:
  - **Fatigue** and **looks pale** started 5 days before admission, so timestamp -120 hours (5 days * 24 hours).
  - **Fever** and **abdominal pain** also began 5 days prior, timestamp -120.
  - **Active child** two days before admission: timestamp -48.
  - **Symptoms worsened** 24 hours before admission: timestamp -24.

5. **Admission Events (Timestamp 0)**:
  - **Shock**, **altered consciousness**, vital signs (heart rate, BP, respiratory rate), **oxygen saturation**, physical findings (no spleen/liver enlargement), and initial treatments (fluid resuscitation, transfusion, intubation) are at admission (0).
  
6. **Diagnostic Findings**:
  - Laboratory results (hemoglobin, leukocyte count, ferritin), imaging (chest X-ray), and serology (COVID-19 IgM, dengue IgM) are timestamp 0 as they are part of the admission workup.

7. **Treatment and Progression**:
  - **Refractory septic shock**, **multiple organ failure**, and **death** occur during the 14-hour stay in the emergency unit, so timestamp 14.

8. **Negated Symptoms**:
  - No cough, breathing difficulties, bleeding, rashes, travel history, or COVID-19 contact are noted before admission, timestamp -120.

This approach ensures all clinical events are captured with approximated timestamps based on the narrative.
