    Here's how I approached creating the table:,
1. **Identified the admission event**: The patient was admitted with septic arthritis of the right knee. This sets the timestamp at 0 hours.,
"2. **Handled prior events**: The case mentions events that occurred four months before admission (coronary artery bypass, Staphylococcus aureus infection, etc.). Converted four months to approximately -2904 hours (4 * 30 days * 24 hours).",
"3. **Timed deterioration events**: Renal function deteriorated on Day 15, which is 360 hours after admission.",
4. **Treatment timelines**: Continuous venovenous haemofiltration started on Day 38 (912 hours) and intermittent haemodialysis on Day 67 (1608 hours).,
"5. **Discharge timing**: The patient was discharged after a 6-month stay, which is approximately 4320 hours (6 * 30 days * 24 hours).",
"6. **Incorporated negative findings**: ""no hydronephrosis"" and ""no eosinophilia"" were included with their respective timestamps.",
"7. **Handled durations**: For events with durations like receiving pentastarch over 2 months, the start time (Day 11) was used, which is 264 hours.",
"By systematically parsing the timeline and converting all mentioned days into hours relative to admission, I constructed the comprehensive event table.</s>",
