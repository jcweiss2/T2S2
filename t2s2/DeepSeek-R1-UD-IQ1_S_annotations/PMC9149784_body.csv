    Here's a step-by-step explanation to create the event timeline:,
    1. **Identify the admission event**: The patient is admitted to the hospital with bacteraemia and device infection. This is considered the reference point (time 0).,
    2. **Extract events from the timeline provided**:,
"      - Day 0: Admitted, started on IV antibiotics.",
      - Day 1: Device extraction and debridement.,
      - Day 9: Blood cultures negative.,
      - Day 18: New device placement.,
      - Day 25: First tamponade and pericardiocentesis.,
      - Day 28: Second tamponade and pericardiocentesis.,
      - Day 31: Pericardial window.,
      - Day 38: Discharge.,
      - Day 51: Antibiotics completed.,
"      - 2 months post-discharge: Effusion-free, chest tube removed.",
      - 4 months post-discharge: Effusion-free.,
    3. **Convert days to hours**:,
      - Each day = 24 hours.,
      - Admission (Day 0) = 0 hours.,
      - Device extraction (Day 1) = 24 hours.,
      - Blood cultures (Day 9) = 216 hours.,
      - New device (Day 18) = 432 hours.,
      - First tamponade (Day 25) = 600 hours.,
      - Second tamponade (Day 28) = 672 hours.,
      - Pericardial window (Day 31) = 744 hours.,
      - Discharge (Day 38) = 912 hours.,
      - Antibiotics completed (Day 51) = 1224 hours.,
      - 2 months post-discharge ≈ 1440 hours.,
      - 4 months post-discharge ≈ 2928 hours.,
    4. **Account for pre-admission events**:,
      - Fever and nausea 1-2 days before admission: Assigned -48 to -24 hours (used -48 as the start).,
      - Previous admission 4 months prior: Not included as per focus on current admission events.,
    5. **Include clinical findings during admission**:,
      - Symptoms on Day 25 (tamponade) at 504 hours.,
      - Follow-up events post-discharge at 1440 and 2928 hours.,
    6. **Separate conjunctive phrases**:,
"      - ""fever and nausea"" split into two events.",
"      - ""trace pedal and pretibial pitting edema"" split into two.",
    7. **Assign timestamps based on the narrative**:,
      - All events during admission days converted to hours.,
      - Post-discharge follow-ups converted based on months (approx. 730 hours/month).</s>,
