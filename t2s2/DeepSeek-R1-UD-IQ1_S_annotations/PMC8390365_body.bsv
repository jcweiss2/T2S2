Alright, let's tackle this case report and extract all the clinical events along with their timestamps. The main admission event is at time 0, and everything else is relative to that. If there's no specific time mentioned, I'll need to estimate based on context or my medical knowledge.

First, the patient is a 61-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with massive hemoptysis. That's the admission event, so timestamp 0. 

He has a history of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed 3 months prior to admission. Since 3 months is about 2160 hours, and since this happened before admission, it'll be -2160. Around the same time, he started having a persistent cough and expectoration, so those are also at -2160. 

A week before admission, he had streaky hemoptysis episodes. A week is 168 hours, so that's -168. 

During his prior admission for severe COVID-19 pneumonia, he received treatments like methylprednisolone, remdesivir, tocilizumab, enoxaparin, and high flow oxygen. All these happened 3 months ago, so -2160.

At admission, he tested negative for COVID-19, was shifted to the intensive unit, received tranexamic acid, Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure, and blood transfusion. All these are at 0.

The imaging showed fibrotic sequelae, cavitary areas, and the pseudoaneurysm, which were present at admission, so timestamp 0. The embolization procedure was done during admission, so also 0.

After the procedure, there were no further hemoptysis episodes, improved oxygen, and follow-up CT at 2 weeks (336 hours), so those are at +336.

I need to make sure all events are captured, even those without explicit times, using context to estimate. Also, separate combined terms like "persistent cough with expectoration" into individual events. Check for any missed events, like underlying conditions or treatments. 

Wait, the pandemic outbreak is mentioned as starting 1.5 years before the case. If the case is in 2020, but the exact timing isn't clear. Since it's background info, maybe it's not directly a patient event, but the case report was written during the pandemic. The patient's COVID diagnosis was 3 months prior, which is the relevant timestamp here.

Also, the elevated CRP and D-dimer were during prior admission, so should that be at -2160? The case report mentions they were mildly elevated during prior admission, so maybe those are at -2160. But in the current admission, the patient's CRP and D-dimer aren't mentioned, so perhaps the elevation refers to the prior stay. 

Wait, the text says: "During his prior long admission... His CRP and D-dimer levels were mildly elevated (CRP – 3 mg/L; D-dimer -2.03 µg/mL)." So those elevations occurred during the prior admission, which was 3 months ago. Therefore, those events should be at -2160.

At current admission, he had low oxygen saturation (83%), which is at 0. Also, the CTPA was done at admission, so timestamp 0.

The outcome and follow-up happened 2 weeks after admission, which is +336 hours.

I think I've covered all events mentioned. Now, format them into the table with events and timestamps separated by a pipe.
