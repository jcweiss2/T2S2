"Alright, I need to extract all clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is the starting point with timestamp 0. Any events before admission will have negative timestamps, and those after will be positive. If there's no explicit time info, I'll use context to approximate.",
"First, let's identify the admission event. The patient presented to the emergency department in April 2011 with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and inability to defecate or pass gas. This is the main admission event, so timestamp 0.",
"Now, looking at prior events. He had been admitted to separate healthcare facilities a couple of times over five years for abdominal pain and constipation. Five years is about 43,200 hours. Since these occurred before the current admission, the timestamp is -43200. Also, no pathology was found during these previous visits, so that's also -43200.",
"He lost 5-6 kg in the last year. One year is 8760 hours, so timestamp -8760. His hypertension controlled by a salt-free diet is part of his medical history at admission, so timestamp 0.",
"On admission, his general appearance was cachectic, abdomen distended, mucosae dry. Vital signs: BP 90/50, pulse 95, temp 37.9°C. Physical exam showed rebound tenderness and guarding. These are all part of the admission, so timestamp 0.",
"Lab results (WBC, Hb, BUN, creatinine) and the X-ray findings are from admission, so 0. The decision for surgery based on findings (tumoral obstruction or perforation) is part of admission, timestamp 0.",
"Surgical events: laparotomy, exploration revealing encapsulation, dense membrane, adhesions, loop ileostomy—all during the operation, which is part of the admission timeline, so 0. Post-op, he went to ICU, so timestamp 0. Treatments like fluid replacement, antibiotics started here, timestamp 0.",
"He died three days after the operation (72 hours), so events like septic shock, multiorgan failure, lab results at death have timestamp 72.",
"I need to ensure all events are captured and times are logical. For example, ""lost 5-6 kg"" happened in the last year, so -8760. Previous admissions over five years are -43200. Admission-related findings are 0. Post-op events at 72 hours.",
