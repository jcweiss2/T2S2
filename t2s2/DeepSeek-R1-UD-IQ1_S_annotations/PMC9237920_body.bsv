**Step-by-Step Explanation**

To create a table of clinical events with timestamps based on the case report, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Events**: Extract all significant medical events mentioned in the case report. This includes symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and outcomes.

2. **Determine Timestamps**: Assign a timestamp to each event relative to the admission event (timestamp 0). Use the information provided in the text to calculate time differences. If explicit times are not given, use approximations based on context.

3. **Handle Negative and Positive Times**: Events before admission have negative timestamps (hours before admission), and events after admission have positive timestamps (hours after admission).

4. **Break Down Compound Phrases**: Separate combined descriptions (e.g., "fever and rash") into individual events ("fever", "rash") and assign the same timestamp to each.

5. **Include All Events**: Ensure all events, including those in the discussion, follow-up, and outcomes, are included. Do not omit any mentioned events.

6. **Use Clinical Judgment for Approximations**: When exact times are not available, use clinical knowledge to estimate plausible timestamps based on surrounding events.

**Final Answer**

Here is the table of clinical events with their timestamps:
