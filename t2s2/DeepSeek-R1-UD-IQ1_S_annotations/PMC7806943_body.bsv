Alright, let's tackle this case report. The patient is a 7-year-old boy with a complicated medical history. He's been referred to the University Children's Hospital Tuebingen after a second relapse of pre-B-ALL. His first relapse was treated with allogeneic HSCT from an unrelated donor. Upon admission (day 0), his bloodwork showed compromised values: hemoglobin 8.5 g/dl, thrombocytes 13,000/μl, WBC 940/μl with 50/μl neutrophils, CRP 6.83 mg/dl, and ferritin 182 μg/dl. He presented with a chronically reduced general condition, cachexia, dry skin, pallor, multiple hematomas, and hepatosplenomegaly. 

He received prophylaxis with ceftriaxone, teicoplanin, acyclovir, and caspofungin. Even before starting blinatumomab, he had left flank pain treated with morphine. On day +5 of blinatumomab, the pain worsened. An ultrasound showed no pathology except known hepatosplenomegaly. By day +6, he became somnolent and sleepy, initially thought to be a morphine overdose. After reducing the dose, he still had delayed responses. A cerebral CT and MRI showed multiple hemorrhages. He decompensated cardio-respiratorily, moved to ICU, got mechanical ventilation and catecholamines, and blinatumomab was stopped. His blood counts dropped further: hemoglobin 6.7 g/dl, thrombocytes 49,000/μl, WBC 120/μl with 20/μl neutrophils, CRP 23.13 mg/dl, ferritin 1439 μg/dl. Echocardiography revealed thrombi in both ventricles, leading to suspicion of thromboembolic events. Antibiotics were intensified with meropenem, teicoplanin, gentamicin; caspofungin continued. CT scans 12 hours later showed systemic thromboembolic lesions in lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, intestines, muscles. Bone marrow aspiration showed aplasia with blasts. Cerebral pressure rose, and he died from herniation on day +7. Autopsy revealed invasive R. pusillus mycosis.

Starting with the admission event, which is at time 0. The events before admission, like the first relapse treated with HSCT four weeks prior, would be -672 hours (4 weeks * 7 days * 24 hours). The initial presentation on admission includes his compromised blood values and physical signs, all at 0. The prophylaxis medications (ceftriaxone, teicoplanin, acyclovir, caspofungin) started on admission, so also 0. The left flank pain started before blinatumomab, but since blinatumomab started on day 0, the pain's time is 0. The pain aggravated on day +5, which is 5 days * 24 = 120 hours. Ultrasound done same day, 120. Day +6 symptoms (somnolence, sleepiness) at 144 hours. Cerebral imaging at 168 hours. Transfer to ICU, stopping blinatumomab, worsening blood counts at 168. Echocardiography findings and antibiotic changes also at 168. Subsequent CT scans 12 hours later would be 180. Bone marrow results at 180. Cerebral herniation and death at day +7, which is 192 hours. Autopsy findings at 192.

Neutropenia was present on admission (0). Disseminated disease and fungal infection identified later, around the time of CT scans (180). Caspofungin prophylaxis started at 0. The delay in diagnosis and treatment would be around the time symptoms worsened (168). Fulminant mucormycosis onset around 180. Blinatumomab treatment started at 0, stopped at 168. HSCT history is at -672. Each event is assigned based on when it happened relative to admission (day 0). If no specific time is given, but part of a sequence, I estimate based on progression. For example, pain aggravated on day +5 is 120 hours. Events leading up to death are placed progressively. Autopsy after death is at 192.
