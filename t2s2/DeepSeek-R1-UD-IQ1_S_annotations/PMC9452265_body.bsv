    Here's the step-by-step explanation:

    1. **Admission Event (Timestamp 0)**:
    - The patient was referred to the otorhinolaryngology service of a tertiary hospital on the following day after initial treatment in the Emergency Unit. The admission event is assigned timestamp 0.

    2. **Events Before Admission**:
    - Fever, asthenia, odynophagia, and daily episodes of epistaxis started one week before admission (7 days = -168 hours).
    - Denial of expelling foreign bodies also occurred before admission (-168 hours).
    - Cacosmia and foul-smelling nasal crusts for three years (-3 years = -26208 hours).
    - Diabetes and hypertension are chronic conditions but are noted on admission, so timestamp 0.

    3. **Events at Admission (Timestamp 0)**:
    - Clinical findings on admission: afebrile, oriented, cooperative, crackles in lungs, mucopurulent secretion in ear, peritonsillar bulging, hyperemia extending to soft palate.
    - Initial suspicion of peritonsillar abscess, first puncture, hospitalization, and initiation of antibiotics.

    4. **Events After Admission**:
    - Second puncture on the second day (24 hours).
    - Subsequent events like septicemia, transfer to ICU, intubation, medication administration, and daily examinations are assigned timestamps relative to admission (24 hours onwards).
    - Removal of larvae after 72 hours (96 hours) and death on day 30 (720 hours).

    By systematically assigning timestamps based on the narrative, the events are organized chronologically to reflect the patient's clinical course.
