"Okay, so I need to extract the clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. Let's start by reading through the case presentation section carefully.",
"The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of urinary lithiasis. In October 2020, he came in with left colic pain and mild hyperpyrexia (37.5°C). His past history includes left renal SWL in 1990, right pyelotomy in 1998, and parathyroidectomy in 2000. So these past events happened years before the admission, which would be converted to hours. 1990 is 30 years before 2020, so that's about 30*365*24 = 262,800 hours. But the case report says the admission was in 2020, so 1990 is 30 years prior. Similarly, 1998 is 22 years before, and 2000 is 20 years before. But wait, maybe I need to calculate each exactly. Let's see: 1990 to 2020 is 30 years. 30 years * 365 days/year * 24 hours/day = 262,800 hours. But since the case is in 2020, maybe the exact years are 30, 22, and 20 respectively. So for 1990 to 2020, that's 30 years, 1998 to 2020 is 22 years, 2000 to 2020 is 20 years. So converting each to hours: 30*365*24 = 262,800; 22*365*24 = 192,720; 20*365*24 = 175,200. But the way the user instructed, events before the admission (timestamp 0) have negative times. So these past events would be at -262,800, -192,720, and -175,200 hours. But in the example provided earlier, the user treated ""four weeks ago"" as -672 hours. Wait, the user said if there's no temporal info, use approximation based on context. The case report states that the patient had past events in 1990, 1998, 2000. Since the admission is in 2020, these are 30, 22, and 20 years prior. But that would be a very large negative number. However, in the example given by the user, four weeks ago was treated as -672 (4*7*24). So in this case, the past history is from years before, but the user's instruction says to approximate using temporal expressions. The case presentation says ""in 1990 left renal SWL"", ""1998 right pyelotomy"", ""2000 parathyroidectomy"". Since the admission is in 2020, these events are 30, 22, and 20 years prior. But since the user wants to convert all to hours, that's a huge number. However, the user also said if there's no temporal info, use your knowledge and events with temporal expressions before and after to approximate. But in the case report, the exact years are given. So maybe we should calculate the exact time difference in hours. For example, 30 years is 30*365*24 = 262,800 hours. But that's a very large negative number. However, in the user's example, the event was four weeks ago, which was 672 hours. So perhaps here, the past events (1990, 1998, 2000) are treated as historical and their exact time is converted to hours. So left renal SWL in 1990 is 30 years before admission, so -262,800 hours. Similarly, 1998 is 22 years before, which is -192,720 hours, and 2000 is 20 years before, which is -175,200 hours. But the problem is that the case presentation doesn't specify the exact time relation, just the years. So perhaps for the purpose of this task, we need to approximate those exact dates as the user did. But the user's example treated events with clear time expressions (e.g., four weeks ago) as -672, but here, the events are decades prior. However, according to the instructions, we need to include all patient events, even from past history. So those past events would have negative timestamps based on how long before admission they occurred. But given that the admission is in 2020, and the procedures were done in 1990, 1998, 2000, the time difference would be 30, 22, and 20 years, which in hours is 262,800, 192,720, and 175,200 respectively. So those would be negative timestamps. ",
"Now, moving to the admission event: the patient came to the hospital in October 2020 with left colic pain and mild hyperpyrexia. These events are part of the admission, so timestamp 0. The urinalysis and CT scan done during admission would also be at 0. Then he was treated with left ureteral stenting and antibiotics (Meropenem and Gentamicin) in the emergency, which would be at 0 since it's part of the initial treatment upon admission. Then referred for elective ECIRS, which is a planned procedure, so that might be after admission, but the timing isn't clear. But the user said if the time isn't specified, use approximation. Since the referral is part of the initial management, maybe it's at 0. ",
"The pre-operative urinalysis was repeated and found negative, so that's before the procedure. The case says he was administered Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid according to prophylaxis protocol. This would be pre-operative, so perhaps a few hours before the procedure. But since the procedure (ECIRS) was attempted but unsuccessful, leading to conversion to f-URS. The procedure details: 3 unsuccessful renal puncture attempts, converted to f-URS, which took 1 hour operative time. Then the procedure was stopped and deferred to a second look. So the procedure time is during the admission, but the exact timing is unclear. The user said if no time is given, use approximation. Since the procedure was done after admission, and the first day post-op had fever, perhaps the procedure was done on day 0, so the events during the procedure are timestamp 0. ",
"After the procedure, on the first day, patient developed fever (>38°C). That would be 24 hours post-procedure. Blood cultures and antibiotic therapy (Tazobactam and Teicoplanin) were done at this time. Then a CT scan showed pyelonephritis. The antibiotic therapy was modified based on blood cultures positive for Pseudomonas, so Meropenem and Linezolid were administered. This would be 24 hours. ",
"Then the patient was admitted to ICU due to unstable hemodynamics (tachycardia and hypotension) on the first day, which is 24 hours. Wait, but the case says ""on the first day patient developed fever..."", then later ""The patient was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit..."" So the timeline here is that after the procedure, on day 1 (24h), fever occurred. Then after that, he was admitted to ICU. But the case presentation says ""On the first day patient developed fever..."", which would be 24h. Then the ICU admission would be after that, but the exact time isn't specified. However, the case says ""subsequently admitted to ICU"", so maybe same day, so 24h. Then at 4 days post-surgery (4 days after the f-URS procedure), thoracic/abdomen CT was done, showing pulmonary emboli, pleural effusion, renal abscess. So 4 days is 96 hours. CT-guided drain placed and stent replaced at 96h. ",
"On the tenth day (10 days post-op), patient continued to be febrile, CT scan showed no change. Then multidisciplinary counselling led to nephrectomy. The nephrectomy was performed on the tenth day, which is 240h. ",
"After nephrectomy, on the first day (which would be 24h after nephrectomy, so 240+24=264h), patient was not pyretic. Discharged 7 days post-OP (nephrectomy OP), so 7 days is 168h, added to 240h, totaling 408h? Wait, the case says ""discharged on 7 days post-OP"". If the nephrectomy was on day 10 (240h), then 7 days after that would be 240 + 168 = 408h. But the discharge event would be at 408h. ",
"Histological exam done post-discharge, but it's part of the procedure, so timestamp at discharge time (408h). ",
"Now, putting all together:",
"- Demographic info: 50 years old, male, admitted to hospital – all at 0.",
"urinary lithiasis history is part of his past, so maybe treated as historical, but since it's a condition, timestamp 0? Or since it's a past history, but the user's example included ""acne"" as a past diagnosis with a timestamp. So in the example, ""acne"" was diagnosed four weeks ago, so -672. Here, ""urinary lithiasis history"" is a past condition, but the timing isn't specified, so perhaps it's considered part of the admission (0) unless there's a specific time. Since the case says ""positive history of urinary lithiasis"", it's a current condition, so timestamp 0.",
