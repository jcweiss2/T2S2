    The events were extracted based on the timeline provided. Admission to the ICU is considered the event with timestamp 0. Events mentioned in the history (e.g., abdominal pain and dizziness) are assigned timestamps relative to admission, calculated from the described durations (e.g., a 3-day history of abdominal pain leading to admission would be 72 hours before admission, hence timestamp -72). The perioral herpes infection and wound onset are noted to occur 2 days after noninvasive ventilation, translating to 48 hours after admission, hence timestamp +48. Treatment interventions and consultations are assigned timestamp 0 as they occur during the admission period. Discharge is marked at timestamp 0 as the final outcome post-treatment.</s>
