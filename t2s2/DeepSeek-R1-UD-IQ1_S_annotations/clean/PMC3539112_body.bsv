However, the example given by the user in their initial prompt includes discharged at 24 hours. So maybe in this case, we can model the removal of expanders and mesh placement as happening at the time of the definitive repair, which is four months after expander placement. So each event during that operation (removal, mesh placement, skin closure, drains placement, etc.) would be at +10080. The postoperative period is four days, so discharge at +10080 + 96. The follow-up is ten months after discharge, so +10176 + 7200 = +17376. But the case report mentions "during follow-up for ten months", so the no infection etc. are during that time, but we need to assign a single timestamp. The user example includes "discharged | 24", so for this case, discharge is at +96 (four days post-op).
