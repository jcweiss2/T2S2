prednisone |A 59-year-old male patient with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was hospitalized to manage cardiac insufficiency with inotropic therapy. The worsening of his clinical picture required the use of an intra-aortic balloon, and he was prioritized for cardiac transplantation. During the pre-transplant period, the patient did not develop any infectious complications. Blood cultures collected 24 and 48Â h before transplantation were negative.
