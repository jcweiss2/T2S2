The final discharge after rehabilitation is at a later time. The case says he was transferred to subacute care after 27 days, then discharged. So 27 days after the ED admission (which is +1536), that would be 27*24=648 hours, so total timestamp +1536 + 648= 2184. But since the user wants events relative to the initial admission (0), the discharge home after rehabilitation would be at 27 days after ED admission, which is 64+27=91 days after initial admission, so 91*24=2184 hours. However, the case says "He has been subsequently discharged home for further hematology follow-up." So the final discharge is at 2184. But the problem's example had "discharged | 24" from the initial admission. So here, the final discharge would be at 2184.
