After 2 months, her BCVA was hand motion, which is approximately 60 days, so 60*24=1440 hours. But the case says "After 2 months," which would be from the time of the first treatment. Wait, but the first treatment (on day 23) was at +552 hours. So two months after that would be 60 days, so 552 + (60*24)= 552 + 1440= 1992 hours. But the case report says "After 2 months, her BCVA was hand motion..." but it's unclear if that's two months from admission or from the onset of treatment. Since the events after the 23rd day are subsequent, I think "after 2 months" refers to from the time of the initial treatment (day 23). So 2 months is roughly 60 days, so 60*24=1440 hours added to the 552, totaling 1992. But the example output provided by the user in the initial example had "discharged | 24" which was 1 day after admission. So perhaps in this case, "after 2 months" from admission would be 2*30 days = 60 days, 60*24=1440 hours. But the event of BCVA hand motion is at 2 months after discharge? Wait, no. The case report says after 2 months from the time of treatment, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the timeline is structured such that events after the initial treatment (day 23) are at +552, and then subsequent events are added to that.
