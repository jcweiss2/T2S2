1. **term appropriate for gestational age male baby | 0** (birth is at -72, but admission is 0. However, the baby's age is a characteristic, so timestamp 0? Or should birth be at -72? The example in the user's prompt had "18 years old | 0", so demographic details at 0. So here, term appropriate for GA male baby | 0.
2. **referred from Erode | -72** (since referral was on day 18, which is +360, but wait no, the referral happened on day 18 of life, which is 15 days after admission (day 3). Wait, no: the baby was born on day 0, admitted on day 3 (0), then referred on day 18, which is 15 days after admission. So 15 days *24= +360. But in the user's instructions, the admission is timestamp 0. All events before admission are negative, after are positive. The initial referral mentioned in the case report is when the baby was referred to the center on day 18, which is after admission to the first hospital. Wait, the case report says: "He was referred on the 18th day of life to our center in view of persistent symptoms..." So this referral is a separate admission to the center, which would be a new admission? Or is the initial admission on day 3, and then referred on day 18 to another center. In the user's example, the admission is timestamp 0. So here, the initial admission is on day 3 (timestamp 0), and the referral to the center is another event on day 18 (timestamp +360).
