Here is the step-by-step explanation of the answer:,
"1. **Identify the admission event**: The patient was admitted to the hospital, which is assigned timestamp 0.",
2. **Determine events prior to admission**:,
   - The patient presented with high-grade fever and was referred to a nearby clinic 4 days before admission. Converting 4 days to hours: 4 * 24 = -96 hours.,
"   - His wife and two daughters had influenza B diagnosed several days prior. Assuming ""several days"" as 7 days before admission (1 week), the timestamp is -168 hours.",
"   - The rapid test and influenza diagnosis occurred at the initial clinic visit, timestamp -96.",
"   - Oseltamivir administration started at the same time as diagnosis, timestamp -96.",
3. **Events leading to admission**:,
"   - Persistent fever and dyspnea at rest occurred 1 day before admission (24 hours prior), assigned -24 hours.",
4. **Events at admission (timestamp 0)**:,
"   - Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation).",
   - Physical exam findings (fine crackles).,
"   - Laboratory results (WBC, CRP, AST, LDH, CK, Krebs von den Lungen-6).",
   - Arterial blood gas analysis and oxygen therapy.,
   - Imaging findings (chest radiography and CT).,
"   - Negative microbiological studies (stains, cultures).",
"   - Initial treatments (high-flow oxygen, peramivir, antibiotics).",
5. **Post-admission events**:,
"   - Day 3 (72 hours): Worsening CT findings, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ARDS diagnosis, treatment proposals (mechanical ventilation, PEEP), refusal of intubation, hemoperfusion.",
"   - Day 6 (144 hours): Methylprednisolone started, respiratory status unimproved, worsening infiltrates, addition of NPPV and cyclophosphamide.",
"   - Day 129 (3096 hours): Patient died, autopsy performed, pathological findings (DAD, hyaline membranes), no organ abnormalities.",
"6. **Separation of conjunctive phrases**: For example, ""high-grade fever"" and ""referred to a nearby clinic"" are separate events with the same timestamp (-96). Similarly, ""wife and two daughters"" are split into two events.",
"7. **Handling durations**: Events like treatments (e.g., oseltamivir, antibiotics) are assigned the start time. Persistent symptoms (e.g., fever) are assigned when they are noted again.",
"8. **Inclusion of all events**: Pertinent negatives (e.g., negative stains, cultures) and all treatments (including refusals) are included with their respective timestamps.",
