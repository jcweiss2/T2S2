"Alright, I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. First, let's identify the main admission event, which will have a timestamp of 0. All events before admission get negative hours, and those after get positive hours.",
Looking at the case report:,
- The patient is a 62-year-old female. Her age and gender get timestamp 0.,
