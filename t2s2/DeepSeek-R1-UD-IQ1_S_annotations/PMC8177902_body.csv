"Alright, let's break down the case report step by step to extract all clinical events and assign accurate timestamps. ",
"First, the patient is a 43-year-old female who presented with continuing fever, lower abdominal pain, and foul-smelling discharge from her left perianal region for 2 weeks. The 2-week duration translates to -336 hours (since each day is 24 hours, 14 days * 24 = 336 hours). These symptoms started before admission, so their timestamps are all -336.",
"Upon admission (time 0), the physical examination found necrotic tissue and foul-smelling thin pus. The initial surgery, debridement of the left perianal region revealing deep abscess pockets, happens at admission, so timestamp 0.",
"On the second postoperative day (48 hours after surgery), her lower abdominal pain worsened, leading to an ultrasound showing fluid collection. Laparotomy at this time revealed extensive abscesses and necrotic tissue. All these events occur at 48 hours.",
"The patient was transferred to ICU, antibiotics were changed, and relaparotomy was done 48 hours after the first surgery (so 48 + 48 = 96 hours). No disease progression was found here. ICU stay and continued antibiotics for 2 weeks (14 days * 24 = 336 hours) start at 96 hours.",
"On the 35th day after initial debridement (35 days * 24 = 840 hours), the fascia defect was reconstructed, the abdomen closed, and the perianal wound closed. Follow-ups at 3, 6, and 9 months (each month as 30 days, so 3*30*24=2160, 6*30*24=4320, 9*30*24=6480 hours) show positive outcomes.",
"I need to ensure all events are captured, including those during discussions like the antibiotic duration and reconstruction details. Pertinent negatives, like no previous medical illness, are timestamped at 0 as they're part of the admission assessment.",
