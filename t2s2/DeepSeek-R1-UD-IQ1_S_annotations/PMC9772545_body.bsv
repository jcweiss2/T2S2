You are a physician.  Extract the clinical events and the related time stamp from the case report. The admission event has timestamp 0. If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0. The events happened before event with 0 timestamp have negative time, the ones after the event with 0 timestamp have positive time. The timestamp are in hours. The unit will be omitted when output the result. If there is no temporal information of the event, please use your knowledge and events with temporal expression before and after the events to provide an approximation. We want to predict the future events given the events happened in history. For example, here is the case report.\
An 18-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of fever and rash. Four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and received the treatment with minocycline, 100 mg daily, for 3 weeks. With increased WBC count, eosinophilia, and systemic involvement, this patient was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome. The fever and rash persisted through admission, and diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus was present. One day later the patient was discharged.\
Let's find the locations of event in the case report, it shows that four weeks ago of fever and rash, four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and receive treatment. So the event of fever and rash happen four weeks ago, 672 hours, it is before admitted to the hospital, so the time stamp is -672. diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus was documented on the admission exam, so the time stamp is 0 hours, since it happens right at admission. DRESS syndrome has no specific time, but it should happen soon after admission to the hospital, so we use our clinical judgment to give the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome the timestamp 0. then the output should look like\

Separate conjunctive phrases into its component events and assign them the same timestamp (for example, the separation of 'fever and rash' into 2 events: 'fever' and 'rash')  If the event has duration, assign the event time as the start of the time interval. Attempt to use the text span without modifications except 'history of' where applicable. Include all patient events, even if they appear in the discussion; do not omit any events; include termination/discontinuation events; include the pertinent negative findings, like 'no shortness of breath' and 'denies chest pain'.  Show the events and timestamps in rows, each row has two columns: one column for the event, the other column for the timestamp.  The time is a numeric value in hour unit. The two columns are separated by a pipe '|' as a bar-separated file. Skip the title of the table. Reply with the table only. Create a table from the following case:

pmc1 IntroductionAorta dissection (AD) is a rare, life-threatening disorder resulting from a tear in the aortic wall. Aortic dissection is induced by intimal-medial tear and tearing, resulting in the creation of a false lumen. AD is associated with a high death rate, with an estimated incidence of 3â€“4 cases per 100,000 people each year. Type A dissection is characterized by a tear in the ascending aorta, whereas type B dissection is characterized by a rip distal to the left subclavian artery in the descending aorta.1The paired internal pudendal arteries, branches of the internal iliac arteries from the aorta, supply the penis with blood. This circulatory network can be disrupted by AD, resulting in penile necrosis.2,3We discuss the case of a 30-year-old male with acute limb ischemia, necrosis of the penis, and scrotum gangrene. This is one of the few instances of penile and scrotal necrosis that highlights the peculiar pattern of decreased blood flow congruent with this patient's clinical complaints.2 Case presentationA 30-year old male patient came to the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital with complaints of paralysis of both legs and the skin getting darker 2 weeks before admission. The patient was consulted by general surgeon due to pain and darkening of the scrotum and penis. The patient said the complaint appeared after the patient's waist was strained when playing a kite. About an hour after the incident he felt very weak and loss the urge to urinate and defecate. The patient complained of bedwetting. There is no haematuria or cloudy urine. The physical examination showed local bluish on the both legs to the level of the femoral half and any stimulus was not felt showing a sign of diminished circulation to the lower part of the body. The genital status showed visible necrosis from the penis to the scrotum, some appear hyperaemia without pus or active bleeding (Fig. 1). FC 16 French was placed with normal urine production. Patients underwent laboratory tests that showed a sign of systemic infections with WBC reached 27.000 per mm.Fig. 1 Pre-operative clinical documentations, a visible necrosis from penis to scrotum, some appears hyperemia without pus or active bleeding.Fig. 1The patient was diagnosed with acute limb ischemia and penile necrosis. Therefore, the patient underwent an aorta thoracoabdominal CT Scan with contrast to confirm the potential cause of these conditions.The CT-Scan (Fig. 2) showed a dissection from the aortic arch to the abdominal aorta about 2 cm above the common iliac bifurcation, and proximal a. superior mesenteric (Stanford B, DeBakey III), with an intimal tear (inlet) at the level of the aortic arch about 2.3 cm distal to the branch of the left subclavian artery. Truncus celiacus, superior mesenteric artery, and left renal artery originate from the false lumen. Thrombus in the false lumen of the abdominal aorta at infrarenal level causing occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta, accompanied by collateralization in the common bilateral femoral artery from branches of the superficial anterior artery and bilateral lateral abdominal walls arteries.Fig. 2 CT-Scan of the patient showed dissection from the aortic arch to the abdominal aorta about 2 cm above the common iliac bifurcation, and proximal a. superior mesenteric (Stanford B, DeBakey III), with an intimal tear (inlet) at the level of the aortic arch about 2.3 cm distal to the branch of the left subclavian artery and thrombus in the false lumen of the abdominal aorta at infrarenal level causing occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta.Fig. 2On the next day, the patient was prepared for Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) and open thrombectomy to treat the life-threatening aortic dissection to resolve the ischemia problem. The patient was unconscious and put on ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU) after the procedure.Debridement and amputation was performed in the following 4 days after TEVAR procedure. The debridement of the penis and scrotum was planned and followed with the amputation above the knee procedure for both legs to get over the source of infection by the vascular surgery division. Urinary diversion with percutaneous cystostomy was performed. Some glans and skin of the penile shaft were black with the appearance of necrosis and blackish scrotal skin was observed with slough. Removal of necrotic tissue from the glans penis, penile shaft, and scrotum was performed until healthy tissue is exposed. Debridement was performed until healthy tissue is acquired and refreshed the borders of the previous incision and removed fibrotic tissue (Fig. 3). The wound was treated openly and patient was sent back to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. Nevertheless, the patient condition worsened due to septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient died during the post-operative care day-8.Fig. 3 Post-operative clinical documentation, debridement was performed until healthy tissue is acquired and refreshed the borders of the previous incision and removing fibrotic tissue followed by open wound treatment.Fig. 33 DiscussionIn this case, the patient experienced Stanford B/De Bakey III causing ischemia in the lower part that interferes with circulation to the iliac arteries which also provide blood supply to the perineal area and genital organs. The internal pudendal arteries branch off into the bulbourethral arteries, which supply the bulb and penile urethra, the dorsal penile arteries, which supply the glans, and the cavernosal arteries, which play a crucial part in the process of tumescence and erection. This intricate vascular network is essential for sustaining the penis' physiological function. This circulatory network can be disrupted by AD, resulting in penile necrosis.1, 2, 3In this patient, the necrotic tissue was found only on the outer part. Hence, debridement was performed to remove the necrotic tissue and infected part instead of a penectomy. The healthy tissue can be found hypothetically due to the collateralization process during the ischemia period. The supply for the tissue could be coming from the formed collateral arteries. Then, the refreshed healthy tissue is determined to be treated openly. In elective surgical cases, there is no harm in leaving the wounds open postoperatively. These wounds can be better managed by leaving the wound exposed to air by the application of 5% povidone iodine solution daily on them. This method not only helps in arresting the infective pathology at a lesser stage but also saves surgeon's time and patient's money.4,54 ConclusionPenile necrosis due to aortic dissection is a very rare case that can occur due to diminished of the circulation to the genital organ. Salvaging the healthy tissue with debridement instead of amputation of the penis can be an option based on the healthy tissue evaluation. Furthermore, systematic management had a critical role beside local source control of infection during sepsis treatment for optimal outcome.

Okay, so I need to create a table of clinical events with their timestamps based on this case report. The admission is timestamp 0, and events before admission are negative, after are positive. Let me parse the case step by step.

First, the patient is a 30-year-old male admitted to the hospital. That's the starting point, so 0.

He had complaints 2 weeks before admission: paralysis of both legs and skin getting darker. Two weeks is 336 hours, so those events are at -336.

He was consulted by a surgeon due to pain and darkening of the scrotum and penis. Since this consultation happened around the time of admission, but the symptoms started after the incident. Wait, the case says the complaints appeared after he strained his waist while playing kite. So the waist strain incident happened about an hour before he felt weak and lost urge to urinate/defecate. So the incident is 1 hour before weakness. The weakness and loss of urge happened 1 hour after the incident. But admission was 2 weeks after these symptoms. So the timeline is a bit tricky.

He strained his waist during kite playing. Then an hour later, he felt weak and lost urge. Then 2 weeks later, he was admitted. So the incident (waist strain) is 336 hours (2 weeks) plus 1 hour before admission? Wait, the complaints started 2 weeks before admission. Let me clarify:

The patient came with complaints (paralysis and skin darkening) that started 2 weeks before admission. But the incident (waist strain) happened before the onset of those complaints. Wait, the case says: "The patient said the complaint appeared after the patient's waist was strained when playing a kite." So the timeline is:

Waist strain (incident) â†’ 1 hour later, weakness and loss of urge â†’ then complaints (paralysis, skin darkening) started and lasted 2 weeks until admission. So the incident is 2 weeks and 1 hour before admission. 2 weeks is 336 hours, plus 1 hour is 337 hours before admission. But the case says the complaints (paralysis, etc.) started after the incident, but the duration is 2 weeks before admission. So the incident is 2 weeks + 1 hour before admission. So the waist strain is at -337 hours. Then the weakness and loss of urge are -336 hours (since the 1 hour after incident is 336 hours before admission). Wait, maybe not. Let me break it down:

- Admission time: 0.

* Two weeks before admission (336 hours before): complaints of paralysis and skin darkening started. So those events start at -336.

* The incident (waist strain) happened just prior to the onset of these complaints. The case says the complaints appeared after the waist strain. So the waist strain is 336 hours before admission (same as the start of the complaints), but the weakness and loss of urge happened an hour after the incident, so -336 + 24 (assuming a day? Wait, no. The incident occurred, then an hour later, he felt weak, etc. So if the incident is at -336 hours, then the weakness is at -335 hours. But the case says "About an hour after the incident he felt very weak..." So the timeline is:

Waist strain (incident) time: t = -336 hours - 1 hour = -337 hours.

Then, 1 hour after incident (t = -336 hours), he felt weakness and lost urge to urinate/defecate.

Then, the complaints (paralysis, skin darkening) started and lasted until admission (2 weeks later). So paralysis and skin darkening started at t = -336 hours and continued until admission.

Bedwetting is mentioned as a complaint, so that's also at -336.

Physical exam findings at admission (t=0): local bluish on legs, diminished circulation, visible necrosis, hyperaemia, no pus, no active bleeding. FC catheter placed, normal urine, WBC 27,000.

Diagnosis of acute limb ischemia and penile necrosis at admission (t=0).

CT scan done at admission (t=0), showing aortic dissection, thrombus, occlusion, collateralization.

Next day after admission (t=24), TEVAR and thrombectomy performed. Patient unconscious, on ventilator, in ICU.

Four days after TEVAR (t=24 + 4 days = 24 + 96 = 120 hours), debridement and amputation done. Urinary diversion, black glans, blackish scrotal skin, slough, removal of necrotic tissue, healthy tissue exposed, refreshed borders, removed fibrotic tissue, open wound treatment.

Patient condition worsened 4 days after TEVAR? Wait, the case says after TEVAR, 4 days later they did debridement. Then, after that, patient was sent back to ICU. Then, post-operative day 8, he died. So TEVAR was day 1 (24 hours), debridement day 5 (4 days later, so 24 + 96 = 120 hours). Then, death on day 8 (8 days after admission: 8*24=192 hours).

So septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction leading to death at 192 hours.

Negative findings: no haematuria, no cloudy urine at admission (t=0).

Putting this all together:

- Age and gender at 0.

7. waist strained when playing kite | -337

8. weakness | -336 (1 hour after incident)

9. loss of urge to urinate | -336

10. loss of urge to defecate | -336

But the case says the complaints (paralysis, etc.) started after the incident. So maybe the paralysis and skin darkening started at -336, which is 2 weeks before admission
