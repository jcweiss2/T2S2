    Here's a step-by-step explanation to create the event timeline:

    1. **Identify the admission event**: The patient is admitted to the hospital with bacteraemia and device infection. This is considered the reference point (time 0).

    2. **Extract events from the timeline provided**:
      - Day 0: Admitted, started on IV antibiotics.
      - Day 1: Device extraction and debridement.
      - Day 9: Blood cultures negative.
      - Day 18: New device placement.
      - Day 25: First tamponade and pericardiocentesis.
      - Day 28: Second tamponade and pericardiocentesis.
      - Day 31: Pericardial window.
      - Day 38: Discharge.
      - Day 51: Antibiotics completed.
      - 2 months post-discharge: Effusion-free, chest tube removed.
      - 4 months post-discharge: Effusion-free.

    3. **Convert days to hours**:
      - Each day = 24 hours.
      - Admission (Day 0) = 0 hours.
      - Device extraction (Day 1) = 24 hours.
      - Blood cultures (Day 9) = 216 hours.
      - New device (Day 18) = 432 hours.
      - First tamponade (Day 25) = 600 hours.
      - Second tamponade (Day 28) = 672 hours.
      - Pericardial window (Day 31) = 744 hours.
      - Discharge (Day 38) = 912 hours.
      - Antibiotics completed (Day 51) = 1224 hours.
      - 2 months post-discharge ≈ 1440 hours.
      - 4 months post-discharge ≈ 2928 hours.

    4. **Account for pre-admission events**:
      - Fever and nausea 1-2 days before admission: Assigned -48 to -24 hours (used -48 as the start).
      - Previous admission 4 months prior: Not included as per focus on current admission events.

    5. **Include clinical findings during admission**:
      - Symptoms on Day 25 (tamponade) at 504 hours.
      - Follow-up events post-discharge at 1440 and 2928 hours.

    6. **Separate conjunctive phrases**:
      - "fever and nausea" split into two events.
      - "trace pedal and pretibial pitting edema" split into two.

    7. **Assign timestamps based on the narrative**:
      - All events during admission days converted to hours.
      - Post-discharge follow-ups converted based on months (approx. 730 hours/month).</s>
