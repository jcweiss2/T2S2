Okay, so I need to extract the clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is at timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and events after have positive. If there's no explicit time info, I have to approximate based on surrounding info. Let me read through the case report carefully.

The patient is a 6-day-old neonate. The case starts with his birth and admission details. He was born by Cesarean section at 38+4 weeks, which is the admission event, so timestamp 0. Prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome and PA-VSD would be at 5 months gestation, which is way before birth. But since the admission is timestamp 0, these diagnoses would be at -5 months, but converting to hours would be a huge negative number. The case report mentions the mother had no antenatal infections, so that's part of history, probably around the same time. At birth, he was icteric and cyanotic with SpO2 78%, and started on prostaglandin. Transferred to NICU. Those are all part of the initial admission, so timestamp 0.

On day 5, he developed abdominal distention and refused to feed. Fever on examination. No tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, abdomen distended, etc. Since the admission is day 0, day 5 would be 5 days later. Each day is 24 hours, so 5 days is 120 hours. But since the admission is at 0, the events on day 5 would be -120 hours? Wait, the admission is timestamp 0, and events before admission would be negative. Wait, the case report says he was born and then transferred to NICU. The events after birth (admission) would be positive. Wait, the case says "On the 5th day, the patient developed abdominal distention..." So if the admission is day 0 (birth), then day 5 is 120 hours after admission (positive). But in the example given, the admission was timestamp 0, and events before admission were negative. Wait, in the example, the 3-day history of fever and rash before admission had timestamps -72 hours. So in this case, the admission is birth (day 0). Then events on day 5 would be 5 days after admission, so +120 hours. But the example treated admission as 0 and prior events as negative. Wait, the case report here starts with the patient's birth and admission. The events after admission (like day 5, day 6) are after the initial admission, so their timestamps would be positive. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the user instruction says: "The admission event has timestamp 0. If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0. The events happened before event with 0 timestamp have negative time, the ones after the event with 0 timestamp have positive time."

In this case, the admission is the initial event (birth and transfer to NICU). So events after admission (like day 5, day 6) have positive timestamps. Wait, but in the example, the admission was the hospital admission, and prior events (like fever and rash 3 days before) were negative. Here, the patient is admitted at birth (timestamp 0). Then, events happening on day 5 and day 6 would be 120 and 144 hours after admission (positive). However, in the case report, the patient was admitted to the NICU at birth (timestamp 0). Then, on day 5, he developed abdominal distention, which is 5 days after admission. So that's +120 hours. Then on day 6, the distention increased, which is +144 hours. The exploratory laparotomy happened on day 6 as well. The patient died on postoperative day 5, so that would be day 6 + 5 days = day 11, which is 264 hours. But wait, maybe the laparotomy was on day 6, and death 5 days after surgery, so that would be day 11, which is 264 hours. But the assistant's previous answer listed 'died' as -168, which seems inconsistent. Hmm. Maybe the assistant considered admission as the initial event (day 0), and events on day 5 as -120, day 6 as -144? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the assistant made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, the case report says:

"A 3,000-g boy was born by Cesarean section at 38+4 weeks of gestation to a 35-year-old mother. The patient had been diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound at 5 months of gestation with Down syndrome and PA-VSD. The mother had no antenatal history of infection or other medical or surgical illnesses. The patient appeared icteric and cyanotic at birth with an SpO2 of 78% on room air. Continuous intravenous prostaglandin at 10 μg/kg/min was used to maintain ductus arteriosus patency. He was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was passing meconium normally. Initial blood test showed normal complete blood count, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in accordance with physiologic jaundice, mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 10.0 mg/L, normal renal function test, and mild electrolyte disturbance.

On the 5th day, the patient developed abdominal distention and refused to feed. On examination, he developed a fever of 38.5°C. There was no tachypnea. Oxygen saturation was at 60–70% on 3 L of oxygen. The lung was clear to auscultation. The abdomen was distended without obvious tenderness or erythema. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound were performed and revealed no pneumoperitoneum or free fluid and no intestinal pneumatosis or portal venous gas (Fig. 1). His blood test showed a normal leukocyte count of 4,210/µL. A diagnosis of NEC, Bell stage IA was made and he was put on empiric intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, amikacin, and metronidazole. He was kept nil by mouth and a nasogastric tube was inserted with intermittent suction.

On the 6th day, the abdominal distention increased. There was generalized tenderness and erythema of the abdomen on examination (Fig. 2). No blood was found on per rectal examination. A repeat abdominal ultrasound was made and revealed pneumoperitoneum and moderate ascites. The bowel loops were distended up to 28 mm. No portal venous gas or pneumatosis intestinalis was detected. A repeat blood test showed a leukocytosis of 11,780/µL with 68.1% neutrophils. C-reactive protein was markedly elevated at 224.3 mg/L. A diagnosis of peritonitis due to perforated hollow viscus was made and he was rapidly transferred for exploratory laparotomy."

So, the initial admission is at birth (day 0). The events on day 5 and day 6 are after admission, so they should have positive timestamps. Each day is 24 hours. Day 5 is 5*24=120 hours, day 6 is 6*24=144 hours. So abdominal distention on day 5 is +120 hours. Then on day 6, the distention increased, which is +144 hours. The exploratory laparotomy would be on day 6, so timestamp +144. The surgery details (midline incision, etc.) would be at +144. The patient was transferred to SICU after surgery, continued antibiotics, and died on postoperative day 5. So death would be 5 days after surgery (postop day 5), which is day 6 + 5 days = day 11, which is 11*24=264 hours. But the assistant's answer lists 'died' at -168, which is conflicting. So maybe the assistant considered the admission as the day when symptoms started? Or made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps the admission event is when he was admitted to the NICU after birth. So birth is timestamp 0. Then the events on day 5 and 6 are after admission. So the timestamps should be positive. However, in the assistant's answer, events like abdominal distention on day 5 are listed as -120. That would imply that the admission event is day 5, but that's not correct. The case report says he was admitted to NICU at birth. So the correct timestamps should be positive for day 5 and 6. But the assistant's answer has them as -120 and -144. That seems incorrect. 

But maybe I'm misunderstanding the instructions. The user says: "If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0." Maybe the initial events (birth, transfer to NICU) are at 0, and the subsequent events are positive. 

So, in the case report, the events on day 5 and day 6 would be at +120 and +144. The exploratory laparotomy on day 6 is +144. The death on postop day 5 would be 5 days after surgery, so +144 + (5*24)= +144 + 120 = +264. 

But the assistant's answer shows all events after admission as negative, which contradicts the instructions. So perhaps the assistant made a mistake. 

Another point: in the user's example, the admission was at 0, and prior events (like 4 weeks ago) were negative. In this case, the admission is the birth and transfer to NICU. Events before that (prenatal diagnosis at 5 months) would be negative. Events after admission (day 5, day 6) would be positive. 

Therefore, the assistant's answer is incorrect in assigning negative timestamps to events on day 5 and 6. Those should be positive. 

But let's proceed step by step. The patient was born (admission) at timestamp 0. Then:

- On day 5: events here are +120 hours.

You are a physician.  Extract the clinical events and the related time stamp from the case report. The admission event has timestamp 0. If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0. The events happened before event with 0 timestamp have negative time, the ones after the event with 0 timestamp have positive time. The timestamp are in hours. The unit will be omitted when output the result. If there is no temporal information of the event, please use your knowledge and events with temporal expression before and after the events to provide an approximation. We want to predict the future events given the events happened in history. For example, here is the case report.\
An 18-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of fever and rash. Four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and received the treatment with minocycline, 100 mg daily, for 3 weeks. With increased WBC count, eosinophilia, and systemic involvement, this patient was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome. The fever and rash persisted through admission, and diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus was present. One day later the patient was discharged.\
Let's find the locations of event in the case report, it shows that four weeks ago of fever and rash, four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and receive treatment. So the event of fever and rash happen four weeks ago, 672 hours, it is before admitted to the hospital, so the time stamp is -672. diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus was documented on the admission exam, so the time stamp is 0 hours, since it happens right at admission. DRESS syndrome has no specific time, but it should happen soon after admission to the hospital, so we use our clinical judgment to give the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome the timestamp 0. then the output should look like\
18 years old| 0\
male | 0\
admitted to the hospital | 0\
fever | -72\
rash | -72\
acne |  -672\
minocycline |  -672\
increased WBC count | 0\
eosinophilia| 0\
systemic involvement| 0\
diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption| 0\
pruritis | 0\
DRESS syndrome | 0\
fever persisted | 0\
rash persisted | 0\
discharged | 24\
Separate conjunctive phrases into its component events and assign them the same timestamp (for example, the separation of 'fever and rash' into 2 events: 'fever' and 'rash')  If the event has duration, assign the event time as the start of the time interval. Attempt to use the text span without modifications except 'history of' where applicable. Include all patient events, even if they appear in the discussion; do not omit any events; include termination/discontinuation events; include the pertinent negative findings, like 'no shortness of breath' and 'denies chest pain'.  Show the events and timestamps in rows, each row has two columns: one column for the event, the other column for the timestamp.  The time is a numeric value in hour unit. The two columns are separated by a pipe '|' as a bar-separated file. Skip the title of the table. Reply with the table only. Create a table from the following case:

IntroductionThe precise diagnosis and timely treatment of abdominal sepsis in neonates is the key to improving outcomes in this fragile population. However, diagnosis remains challenging due to the inability to obtain history, the lack of specific signs and symptoms, and the limited performance of radiological investigations. Peritonitis in this age group can be due to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), complications of intestinal obstruction, as well as iatrogenic gastric and duodenal perforations [1]. Neonatal appendicitis (NA) is extremely rare and can be easily overlooked, leading to a high mortality rate of 28% [2]. Most reported cases in the literature were diagnosed intraoperatively or during postmortem autopsies and were associated with prematurity and significant comorbidities [3]. Here, we report a case of perforated acute appendicitis in a 6-day-old full-term neonate with Down syndrome and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) at our hospital.Case ReportA 3,000-g boy was born by Cesarean section at 38+4 weeks of gestation to a 35-year-old mother. The patient had been diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound at 5 months of gestation with Down syndrome and PA-VSD. The mother had no antenatal history of infection or other medical or surgical illnesses. The patient appeared icteric and cyanotic at birth with an SpO2 of 78% on room air. Continuous intravenous prostaglandin at 10 μg/kg/min was used to maintain ductus arteriosus patency. He was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was passing meconium normally. Initial blood test showed normal complete blood count, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in accordance with physiologic jaundice, mildly elevated C-reactive protein of 10.0 mg/L, normal renal function test, and mild electrolyte disturbance.On the 5th day, the patient developed abdominal distention and refused to feed. On examination, he developed a fever of 38.5°C. There was no tachypnea. Oxygen saturation was at 60–70% on 3 L of oxygen.
