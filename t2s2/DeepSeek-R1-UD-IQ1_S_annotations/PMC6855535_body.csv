"Alright, let's tackle this case report. The user wants me to extract clinical events and their timestamps, with admission as the 0 timestamp. Events before admission get negative hours, after positive. If no time is given, use context to approximate.",
"First, the patient is a 40-year-old man presenting to the hospital after hematemesis. That's the admission event, timestamp 0. The case mentions that four weeks earlier he had catheter ablation for AF. Four weeks is 672 hours, so that's -672. Three weeks after the procedure, he developed chest pain, odynophagia, malaise, headache, and fevers. Three weeks is 504 hours post-ablation, which was at -672. So those symptoms start at -672 + 504 = -168? Wait, no. Wait, the ablation was 4 weeks before admission (-672), and symptoms started 3 weeks after ablation, which would be 3 weeks before admission. So that's 3 weeks = 504 hours before admission, so timestamp -504 for those symptoms.",
"When he presents to the hospital, the symptoms at admission include sepsis, hematemesis, temp 100.8, HR 96, BP 89/50. Those are all at 0. Fluid resuscitation given, timestamp 0. Thoracic CT shows gas along esophageal wall but no perforation or AEF. So those findings are at 0.",
"Transferred to ICU, timestamp 0. Another CT done, same findings, still no clear AEF. Patient unstable for esophagram, so that's 0. Consulted GI, upper endoscopy without CO2, couldn't examine. Then minimal CO2 used. After CO2 insufflation, blood spurting confirmed AEF. That happens during the procedure, which is part of the admission timeline. So that's 0. Then 5 minutes after procedure, patient develops left hemiplegia, gaze deviation, lethargy. 5 minutes is about 0.08 hours, but since the procedure is during admission, maybe these neuro symptoms are shortly after, maybe +24 hours? The user said to approximate if needed. Then emergent surgery, which would be after the neuro symptoms, perhaps same day, so +24. During surgery, they found the defect and esophageal fibers, so those events at +24. Post-op cranial CT shows stroke, same timestamp. CT angiography normal, same time.",
"Later, bacteremia with S. mitis, no endocarditis on echo. These happen after surgery, maybe a few days later, like 10 days (240 hours). Discharged after 20 days (480 hours). IV antibiotics for 6 weeks, outpatient rehab. Follow-up at 3 months (2160 hours). Improvement with mild deficits.",
"Need to ensure all events are captured, split conjunctive phrases, and assign timestamps correctly. Some events might be in the discussion, like the bacteremia and discharge, which are part of the hospital course. Also, negative findings like no perforation or no endocarditis should be included.",
