Alright, so I need to process this case report and extract all the clinical events along with their timestamps. The admission event is at time 0, and other events are relative to that in hours. If there's no explicit time mentioned, I need to infer based on context and other events.

First, the patient is a 40-year-old male referred to the center 2 days after polytrauma in a road traffic accident. So the accident happened 2 days before admission, which is -48 hours. The admission is at time 0.

He had blunt trauma to the chest (right hemothorax) and abdomen (right lower lobe liver laceration) with a fractured right tibia. These injuries occurred at the time of the accident, so all at -48 hours.

On admission, his ISS was 26, SOFA 12, APACHE II 18. These are all at admission time, so 0.

CECT of chest and abdomen was done on admission, so that's 0. His renal parameters were deranged on admission, coagulopathy noted here as well, so both at 0.

In the ICU stay, he progressively became oliguric and anuric by the third ICU day. Since ICU days start from admission (day 1), the third day would be 72 hours (3 days * 24). So oliguric starts at 72, anuric also at 72.

He developed sepsis with multiorgan failure (respiratory, renal, metabolic) which likely started around the same time as becoming oliguric, so 72.

He required intubation and ventilator support on the sixth day of ICU stay. Sixth day is 144 hours (6*24). So intubation and ventilator support at 144. Respiratory distress leading to this would be at 144 as well.

He received heparin-free dialysis on the third, fourth, and sixth days. So third day is 72, fourth 96, sixth 144. Each dialysis event is noted at those times.

No blood products were transfused as there was no active bleeding. Since this decision was made on admission, it's at 0, and active bleeding absence is also 0.

On the sixth day, GCS decreased from 15 to 6. That's 144 hours. Noncontrast CT head revealed hemorrhage in parieto-occipital region and intraventricular extension at the same time. Surgical intervention was planned once coagulation was corrected, which is also at 144. The patient expired within 6 hours of this event, so expiration is at 144.

In the discussion, factors contributing to AKI like hypovolemia (high lactate on admission), contrast-induced nephropathy (CECT done before ICU), inadequate hydration, abdominal compartment syndrome, myoglobinuria—all these are present on admission, so 0.

Coagulopathy is mentioned again as present on admission. The massive intracerebral bleed happened on the sixth day (144). No attempt to correct coagulopathy earlier, which would be around admission, so 0.

FFP recommendations, platelet transfusions, uremia effects on platelets and coagulopathy are all part of the discussion and relate to the admission context, so 0. Medications tested (conjugated estrogens, desmopressin, cryoprecipitate) and TEG suggestion are part of discussion, so 0.

I need to make sure each event is separated and assigned the correct timestamp based on when it occurred relative to admission. Also, conjunctive phrases are split into individual events with same timestamps. All events are included, even negative findings like no active bleeding.
