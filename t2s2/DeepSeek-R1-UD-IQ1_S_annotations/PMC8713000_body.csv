**Step-by-Step Explanation:**,
1. **Admission Event:** The patient was admitted for an emergency cesarean section due to arrest of labor. This is assigned a timestamp of 0 hours.,
2. **Prior Events:**,
"   - Bradycardia and hypotension occurred during the cesarean section. Since these happened during the procedure (which is part of the admission event), they are assigned a slightly negative timestamp (-0.5 hours) to indicate they occurred just before the main admission events.",
3. **Post-Cesarean Events:**,
   - Postpartum hemorrhage with estimated blood loss of ~2L occurred shortly after cesarean section. This is assigned timestamp 0 as it's part of the admission process.,
"   - Hypoxemia and refractory hypotension developed despite resuscitation, assigned 24 hours post-admission.",
4. **Laboratory Findings:**,
"   - All lab results (DIC evidence, acute kidney injury, blood gas results, EKG findings, elevated troponin) are noted post-admission and assigned 24 hours.",
5. **Diagnostic Imaging:**,
"   - Echocardiogram findings (RV dilation, McConnell’s sign, tricuspid regurgitation, IVC thrombus) and CT findings (pulmonary embolism, gonadal vein thrombosis, renal cortical necrosis) are part of the diagnostic process post-admission, assigned 24 hours.",
6. **Treatment Initiation:**,
   - Norepinephrine started at 48 hours.,
   - Epinephrine and dobutamine administered earlier at 24 hours.,
   - Anticoagulation with heparin started at 48 hours.,
7. **Clinical Progress:**,
   - Hemodynamic improvement and pressor weaning at 72 hours.,
"   - Renal replacement therapy initiated at 48 hours, transitioning to hemodialysis at 144 hours.",
8. **Discharge and Follow-Up:**,
   - Discharge occurs at 288 hours (approximately 12 days).,
   - 3-month follow-up and repeat echocardiogram at 2160 hours (3 months).,
**Rationale for Timestamps:**,
- Events during or immediately after cesarean section are considered part of the admission (timestamp 0).,
"5. Subsequent developments (hypoxemia, hypotension) and diagnostic findings are assigned based on typical progression in such cases, with lab results and imaging typically occurring within the first day (24 hours).",
"- Treatments and clinical responses follow over the next days, with discharge after stabilization.",
**Note:** Some timestamps are approximated based on standard clinical timelines as specific times aren't detailed in the case report.,
