* Java
* OpenCV
* Boost
* libxml2
* libicu
* zlib
* libpng
* libjpeg

For Ubuntu, you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake python3 python3-dev default-jdk libopencv-dev libboost-dev libboost-all-dev libxml2-dev libicu-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev
```

If you are using another OS, please check the corresponding package manager to install these dependencies.

# Compiling

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject

```bash
cmake .
make
```

This will generate the binaries in the `build` directory.

# Testing

To run the tests, use:

```bash
make test
```

# Usage

After compiling, you can run the main executable with:

```bash
./yourproject
```

Replace `yourproject` with the actual name of your executable.

# Documentation

The documentation is available in the `docs` directory. You can build it by running:

```bash
cd docs
