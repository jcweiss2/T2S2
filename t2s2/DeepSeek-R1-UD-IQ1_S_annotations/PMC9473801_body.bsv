    The assistant's response includes the key events from the case report with their respective timestamps. Admission is at time 0. The thunderclap headache, neck pain, and loss of consciousness occurred before admission, so they are assigned -24 hours (approximated as 1 day before admission). Postoperative events like extubation and neurological recovery are assigned 72 hours (3 days post-admission), and death due to ARDS and septic shock at 192 hours (8 days post-admission).
