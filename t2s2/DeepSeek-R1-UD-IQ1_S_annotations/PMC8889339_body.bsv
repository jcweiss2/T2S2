    Here's the reasoning behind the timestamp assignments:

    - The patient was admitted to the ER (emergency room) at time 0. Events before admission are assigned negative timestamps based on the timeline provided in the case report.

    - The patient had abnormal vaginal discharge for 2 weeks (336 hours) before visiting the gynecologist, so that event is at -336 hours.

    - The events during the ER visit and surgery (fluid resuscitation, exploratory laparotomy, etc.) are assigned to -336 hours since they occurred 10 hours before arrival at the ER, but the exact timing is approximated based on the narrative.

    - Postoperative events (extubation, noradrenaline administration, etc.) are assigned relative to the admission time (0 hours), with days converted to hours (e.g., day 2 is 48 hours).

    - Discharge occurred on postoperative day 10, which is 240 hours after admission.

    - The 2-month follow-up is converted to approximately 1440 hours (60 days).
