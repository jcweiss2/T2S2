Alright, so I'm trying to parse this case report and extract all the clinical events with their respective timestamps in hours. The admission event is at time 0, and other events before admission have negative timestamps, while those after have positive. The user provided an example which helps, but I need to make sure I follow the instructions closely.

First, let's start by identifying the patient's details. The patient is a 32-year-old pregnant woman (11 weeks) who was previously healthy. She was hospitalized with hyperemesis. So her age and pregnancy status are at time 0.

She developed sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to ICU admission on day 0. That's the admission event, so ICU admission is at 0. The sepsis and DIC are also at 0 since they're part of the initial admission.

They cultured C. albicans from blood and urine, which happened during the initial admission, so those events are at 0. The susceptibility tests for various antifungal agents were done here too, so all MICs results are at 0.

Treatment started with LE-AMB 4 mg/kg, caspofungin, and antibiotics. Then, due to creatinine increase, the L-AMB dose was reduced to 2 mg/kg. These treatments started at admission, so their timestamps are 0.

The patient was treated with the combination for 12 days, which would be 12 * 24 = 288 hours. But since the admission is day 0, the 12 days would start from day 0, so the end of the 12-day treatment would be at 288 hours. However, the events here are the initiation of treatment, not the duration. So the initiation of L-AMB, caspofungin, and antibiotics are at 0. The dose reduction due to creatinine is also part of the initial treatment adjustment, so timestamp 0.

She was discharged from ICU to another department on day 18. Day 18 is 18 * 24 = 432 hours. So discharge from ICU is at 432 hours. But in the example, discharge was at 24 hours because the case mentioned "one day later," so 24. Here, day 18 is 18 days, which is 432 hours. However, the user wants timestamps in hours, so day 18 is 18*24=432.

At that time, her CRP was fluctuating, and she had a slight fever. These events are at 432 hours.

She lost her fetus and had kidney failure leading to hemodialysis dependence, which occurred during her stay, so those are at 432 as well.

Discharged from the hospital on day 43: 43*24=1032 hours. At discharge, she had no fever, WBC of 7.69, and CRP 188. These are at 1032.

A month later (day 77) she was admitted to Infectious Diseases. Assuming a month is 30 days, day 77 would be 77 days from initial admission. But the initial admission was day 0, so day 77 is 77*24=1848 hours. But the discharge on day 43 was from the hospital, so the readmission on day 77 is a new event. The timestamp should be relative to the new admission? Wait, the instructions say that the admission event has timestamp 0. So perhaps each admission is a new timestamp 0? Wait, no. The user's example treated admission as timestamp 0, and all other events are relative to that. So in the example, the admission was the main event at 0, and other events were relative to that. But in this case, there are multiple admissions. The initial admission is day 0, then discharge on day 43, then readmission on day 77. So for the second admission, day 77 is another admission, which would be timestamp 0 for that episode. But the user's instructions aren't clear on how to handle multiple admissions. The example only had one admission. The user's instruction says: "The admission event has timestamp 0. If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0." So maybe each admission is a new timestamp 0? But in the example, the initial admission was at 0, and other events (like discharge) had positive timestamps. So in this case, the initial admission is at 0, subsequent events (discharge from ICU, discharge from hospital, readmission) are each with their own timestamps relative to their own admissions? Or is the entire timeline based on the initial admission?

Wait, the user's instruction says: "The admission event has timestamp 0. If the event is not available, we treat the event, e.g. current main clinical diagnosis or treatment with timestamp 0. The events happened before event with 0 timestamp have negative time, the ones after the event with 0 timestamp have positive time."

So in this case, the initial admission is day 0 (timestamp 0). Subsequent events after that admission have positive timestamps. When she is discharged on day 43, that's a positive timestamp (43*24=1032). Then, when she is readmitted on day 77, that's a new admission, but according to the instructions, each admission is a new timestamp 0? Or is the entire timeline based on the initial admission?

Hmm, perhaps the initial admission is the main timestamp 0, and all subsequent events (even if they involve readmissions) are timed relative to that initial admission. Because the case is a single patient's timeline, so all events are relative to the first admission. For example, in the example, the patient was admitted, then discharged one day later (24 hours). So in this case, the readmission on day 77 would be 77 days after the initial admission, so 77*24=1848 hours. So the readmission event would have a timestamp of 1848. But according to the instructions, admission events have timestamp 0. But in this case, the initial admission is at 0, and the readmission is a separate event with its own timestamp. So perhaps the readmission is not considered a new admission for timestamp purposes but is just another event in the timeline. So the readmission on day 77 would be at 77*24=1848 hours.

So for the case, the initial hospitalization with hyperemesis is at 0. Then, ICU admission is at 0 as part of that initial admission. Then, the various treatments, discharge from ICU on day 18 (432 hours), discharge from hospital on day 43 (1032), then readmission on day 77 (1848), etc.

So each event's timestamp is calculated based on days from the initial admission (day 0), converted to hours. So day 18 is 18*24=432, day 43 is 43*24=1032, day 77 is 77*24=1848, etc.

Now, let's go through the case step by step.

Introduction isn't relevant; case starts in section 2.

Case: 32-year-old pregnant woman (11 weeks), previously healthy, hospitalized with hyperemesis. So these are at 0.

She developed sepsis and DIC, admitted to ICU on day 0. So sepsis and DIC at 0, ICU admission at 0.

C. albicans cultured from blood (6/6 cultures) and urine. Isolate susceptible to all antifungals. MICs for various drugs. All these events are during the initial admission, so timestamp 0.

Treatment started with L-AMB 4 mg/kg, caspofungin 70 mg, broad-spectrum antibiotics. Then L-AMB reduced to 2 mg/kg due to creatinine increase. These are treatment initiations and adjustments at 0.

Patient was treated with the combination for 12 days: this is a duration, but the event is the initiation, which is at 0. Then L&AMB and antibiotics continued for 9 more days: again, duration, but the continuation is part of the initial treatment, so maybe not an event? Or the discontinuation of caspofungin after 12 days? Hmm. The case says she was treated with the combination for 12 days, then L-AMB and antibiotics continued for 9 more days. So perhaps the combination of caspofungin + L-AMB + antibiotics for 12 days (so until day 12), then L-AMB and antibiotics continued until day 21 (12+9). But as events, the start of each treatment is at 0, and the discontinuation or change after 12 days would be at 12*24=288 hours. But the user's instructions say to include discontinuation events. So the discontinuation of caspofungin at day 12 would be an event at 288 hours. Similarly, continuation of L-AMB and antibiotics would be ongoing, so maybe not an event unless there's a change. But the case says "continued for 9 more days"—so perhaps after day 12, they continued for 9 days, ending at day 21. But as events, the discontinuation of caspofungin at day 12 is an event at 288 hours. However, the case doesn't explicitly state that caspofungin was stopped, just that the combination was used for 12 days. Maybe the caspofungin was part of the initial 12-day treatment, then stopped while L-AMB and antibiotics continued. So the discontinuation of caspofungin would be at 288 hours. Similarly, the continuation of L-AMB and antibiotics would just be ongoing, not an event. So I need to parse this carefully.

The case says: "Treatment with L-AMB (initially 4 mg/kg, subsequently 2 mg/kg due to creatinine increase to 340 µmol/l), caspofungin 70 mg and broad-spectrum antibiotics was initiated. The patient was treated with the combination for 12 days, and L-AMB and antibiotics were continued for 9 more days." So the combination (L-AMB, caspofungin, antibiotics) was for 12 days, then L-AMB and antibiotics (without caspofungin) continued for 9 more days. So the discontinuation of caspofungin would be at day 12 (288 hours), and the continuation of L# TIL of a new "battery in a battery" design that allows both the anode and cathode to work as lithium electrodes. The result is a battery with a higher energy density and more stable voltage than current lithium ion batteries, potentially allowing a 30% increase in smartphone battery life

From the article:
&gt;In conventional lithium-ion batteries, the cathode (or positive electrode) is a lithium compound while the anode (or negative electrode) is made of graphite. The cathode and anode are kept apart by a “separator” that prevents them from short-circuiting when they come into contact. 
&gt;By coating both the cathode and anode with a protective lithium layer, the researchers were able to create a “battery within a battery”. Both electrodes are then able to perform as a lithium electrode, which is a technique that results in higher energy density. The battery also has a stable voltage and improved safety compared to existing lithium-ion batteries. 
&gt;The battery is said to maintain a stable voltage output even when the battery is low on charge. This is because both electrodes have similar lithium potentials, so a sharp voltage drop is avoided when the battery is about to run out. The researchers say this property could allow devices to utilize battery energy more efficiently, leading to longer run times. 
&gt;In practical terms, this means smartphone users could see their battery life extended by as much as 30 percent. For example, a phone that currently lasts 1.5 days could run for nearly two days on a single charge. The battery can also be charged at a higher power, which translates to faster charge times. 
&gt;The battery is also safer because it eliminates the need for toxic organic solvents in the electrolyte. These solvents are normally flammable and can pose a fire hazard. The new battery replaces the solvent with an inorganic solution that is nonflammable and more stable. 
&gt;The researchers note that their battery can be applied to all kinds of electronic devices. The battery could also be used to power electric vehicles, allowing them to charge faster and drive for longer distances. The team says they are working on improving the battery’s performance and scaling up production so that it can be commercialized. 
&gt;The research was published in the journal Nano Energy.

So the same as a normal lithium battery but with a coating on both the anode and cathode. That seems like a relatively easy manufacturing change.
If the anode and cathode are the same material, you could just swap them. Then the only thing left would be the separator. So maybe you can even get rid of that. Then the entire battery would be made of a single material. 
But the article says that the anode and cathode are still separated. Maybe they need different layers? The article isn't very technical. 
So in the end, it's possible to have a safer battery that can hold more energy and charge faster. That's great. If this can be scaled up and production can start soon, then maybe next year phones can have these. But I'm not sure how far they are from scaling up.

The article states that the battery can also be charged at a higher power. So even though the battery may take longer to charge due to increased capacity, the higher power charging can offset that. So it's a win for both capacity and charging speed.
>>>  2019-032
I know!  So many times I've thought "the battery capacity is nice, but if only the charging speed was worse then that would make the phone better."  Now they've fixed that!
