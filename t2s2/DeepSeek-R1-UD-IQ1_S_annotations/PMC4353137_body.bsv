Alright, let's tackle this case report step by step. The goal is to extract all clinical events and assign timestamps in hours relative to the admission event (which is at 0). If the timing isn't explicitly stated, I'll need to infer based on context.

First, the patient is a 76-year-old female with mesenteric ischemia scheduled for emergency laparotomy. Admission is the starting point, so all preoperative assessments and diagnoses are at time 0. That includes Mallampati Class 2, no mouth restriction, no anticipated intubation difficulty, neck flexion/extension, blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, ASA grade IV E, hypertension, diabetes, past coronary artery disease, ongoing mesenteric ischemia, severe sepsis, ARDS, lab results (low Hb, hyponatremia).

Next, events during the consultation and decision for general anesthesia with rapid sequence induction are at 0. Preoxygenation for 5 minutes and Sellick's maneuver would be right before induction, so maybe at 0. Then medications: pentothal and rocuronium given. The first attempt to open the mouth after 1 minute would be 60 minutes (since 1 minute = 60 minutes in this context). The second attempt 1 minute later would be 120. 

Failed intubation leads to mask ventilation, continued Sellick's, jaw locked, airway obstruction, attempted nasopharyngeal airway, and unsuccessful attempts. Blind nasal intubation attempted but failed. Equipment not prepared, bronchoscope unavailable, ineffective ventilation, oxygen saturation drop, decision for tracheostomy, summoning surgeon, performing tracheostomy—all these happen after the failed intubation attempts, so around 120. 

Patient desaturates, hemodynamics deteriorate, sustains cardiac arrest, couldn't be revived. These events follow the tracheostomy, so still around 120. Attempts to pull jaw, observing TMJ movement, mouth opening slightly—also at 120. No history of TMJ disorders from relatives, so that's a past event. However, the time isn't specified, but since it's a past history, maybe before admission. But the report mentions "past history of coronary artery disease," which is assigned a negative timestamp. For "no history of TMJ disorders," since it's a past history not related to admission, I'll assign a negative time, but it's unclear. Maybe -? for now.

Malignant hyperthermia and masseter spasm questioned, no triggering drugs—these are discussed post-hoc, so maybe at 0. TMJ displacement during the procedure at 120. Tracheostomy performed at 120. Patient demise at 120.

I need to ensure all events are captured, split conjunctive phrases, and assign timestamps accurately. Some events like past history of coronary artery disease need a negative time, but since there's no specific time, perhaps -? as well. The key is to map each event to when it happened relative to admission (0). Procedures and medications given during preparation are at 0, attempts and subsequent events after induction are at 60 and 120.
