Okay, I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is timestamp 0, and other events are relative to that. Let me start by identifying the key events.

The patient is a 32-year-old male transferred to the hospital. The admission is at time 0. Before admission, he had symptoms for six months: abdominal pain, recurrent ascites requiring paracentesis and albumin therapy. Six months is about 4320 hours (6*30*24), so those events are at -4320.

He initially presented to an outside hospital with difficulty ambulating, nausea, dizziness, and low sodium. That's part of the six-month history, so also -4320. They did a paracentesis there and started ceftriaxone. Then he developed dyspnea and increased oxygen needs. The pleural fluid analysis showed Cryptococcal antigen. So these events happened before transfer, so timestamp -4320. He was started on IV fluconazole before transfer, so that's -4320.

On admission, medical history includes cirrhosis, astrocytoma resection, radiation 20 years ago, VP shunt, and panhypopituitarism. These are historical and timestamp 0. He was on hydrocortisone and desmopressin, with hypernatremia, which are current, so 0.

At admission, afebrile, normal WBC, negative blood cultures, HIV negative, ALT/AST normal, viral panel negative. Started on stress-dose steroids. All these are at 0.

On day +1 (24 hours), symptomatic relief after thoracentesis. Thoracentesis removed 1.5L transudative fluid. So thoracentesis at 24 hours. Day +2 (48 hours), paracentesis shows 206 cells, ceftriaxone stopped. But in the case, paracentesis was performed the following day after day +1, so day +2 is 36 hours. The CT thorax after thoracentesis (day +1) showed pleural effusion and pneumonia. So CT on day +1 (24 hours).

Day +3 (72 hours), serum Cryptococcal Ag positive. ID recommended switching to amphotericin and flucytosine. Day +4 (96), pleural fluid Ag positive. Day +5 (120), blood cultures positive. Pleural and abdominal cultures positive. Transthoracic echo and CT head done on day +5. Lumbar puncture on day +4, CSF Ag positive. CSF culture positive on day +6 (168 hours). VP shunt removed and EVD placed on day +5 (120).

Later, day +11 (264 hours), therapeutic thoracentesis shows exudative fluid. Cultures positive. Patient became lethargic, altered mental status, EEG shows seizures. Levetiracetam, lacosamide, intubation, pressors. AKI, CVVH, flucytose adjustment. Day +13 (312 hours), septic shock, antibiotics changed. Day +14 (336), shock liver, DIC, bleeding. Day +15 (360), comfort care, died.

I need to list all these events with their timestamps. Make sure each event is separated, even if they're part of the same sentence. Also include negative findings like no fevers, no vegetation, no ventriculitis. Pertinent negatives are important. Check if I missed any events, like transfusions or other procedures. Each event gets its own row. If the event is a combination, split into separate events. For example, "abdominal pain and recurrent ascites" becomes two events. 

I think I have all the events, but let me review again. The outside hospital events are at -4320, admission is 0, then each day after admission increments by 24 hours. The timeline seems accurate. Include all the cultures, treatments, procedures, symptoms, and complications. Even the negative findings like no fevers, no vegetation, etc. Need to ensure each is captured. Okay, looks comprehensive.
