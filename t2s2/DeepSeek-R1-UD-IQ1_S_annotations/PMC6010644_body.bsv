Okay, so I need to extract all the clinical events from this case report and assign timestamps to them. The admission event is at time 0. Any events that happened before admission will have negative hours, and after admission will be positive. If there's no specific time given, I have to approximate using context.

First, the patient is a 19-year-old male. Those are basic demographics, so their timestamps are 0. He presented to the Emergency Department with a 5-day history of fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, cough, yellowish sputum, chest heaviness, dyspnea, diarrhea, and reduced oral intake. Since the symptoms started 5 days before admission, that's 5*24=120 hours. So all those symptoms get -120.

When he arrives at the ED (admission), that's timestamp 0. The examination findings like being conscious, dehydrated, cold peripheries, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, use of 15L mask, lung crepitations, liver tenderness, and lack of palpable lymph nodes all happen at admission, so timestamp 0.

Lab results like hemoglobin, WBC, neutrophils, platelets, CRP, kidney injury markers, liver function, ABG, and Dengue tests are done on admission, so timestamp 0. The chest X-ray showing consolidation is also at 0.

Diagnosis of CAP and AKI are made at admission, timestamp 0. Treatments like fluid resuscitation, NIV, inotropic support, ceftriaxone, azithromycin start at 0. His condition deteriorates leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation in ICU, which would be shortly after admission, but since the text says "upon admission" they're at 0? Or maybe after some time. Wait, the case says he was intubated after initial treatment didn't help. But the timeline isn't clear. Hmm.

Bronchoscopy is done on day 2, which is 48 hours after admission. So bronchoscopy and findings like secretions, worsening X-ray, abscess formation, antibiotic upgrade to meropenem and cloxacillin, addition of oseltamivir, haemofiltration, metabolic acidosis, oliguric AKI – all these are at 48 hours.

On day 3, he has persistent fever, worsening parameters, refractory hypotension, and dies. That's 72 hours. Postmortem results like blood cultures, serologies, viral screens, and the tracheal aspirate/BAL culture showing MDR Acinetobacter are also at 72. His smoking status is a risk factor noted at admission, so timestamp 0.

I need to list each event separately, split conjunctive phrases. For example, "fever and rash" becomes two separate events. Also include negative findings like denied travel, no lymph nodes, etc. Make sure all events are included. Timestamp based on when they happened relative to admission.

So, the symptoms before admission get -120. Admission events are 0. Day 2 events are +48, day 3 are +72. The death is at 72. All the lab tests, diagnoses, treatments at admission are 0. Subsequent treatments and findings on day 2 and 3 get their respective times.
