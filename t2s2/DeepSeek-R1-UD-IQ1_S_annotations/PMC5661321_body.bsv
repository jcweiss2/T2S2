Okay, let's break down this case report and extract all the clinical events along with their timestamps. The admission event is at time 0. I need to identify each event, determine when it happened relative to the admission, and assign a timestamp in hours. For events without explicit timing, I'll have to approximate based on context.

First, the patient is a 79-year-old female with hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, and chronic heart failure. She presented for an elective TAVR. The TAVR procedure and placement of temporary TVP wires are part of the admission process, so their timestamps are 0. 

On postoperative day (POD) 1, which is 24 hours after admission, they performed a TTE and decided to remove the pacer wires. Thirty minutes after removal (24.5 hours), she became diaphoretic and hypotensive. They resuscitated her, did a stat TTE, found pericardial effusion, and performed pericardiocentesis. All these events happened 30 minutes after wire removal, so the timestamp is 24.5.

Then on POD 3 (72 hours), she was stable, had minimal fluid drainage, another TTE, and the pericardial drain was removed. Twenty minutes later (72.33 hours), she became unstable again. Another TTE showed fluid reaccumulation, another pericardiocentesis, and other procedures like coronary angiogram and aortogram. These happened 20 minutes after drain removal, timestamp 72.33.

By POD 7 (168 hours), the pericardial catheter was clamped, TTE 2 hours later (168.08), and the drain was removed. Vital signs were monitored for 4 hours, and after 24 hours (192 hours), she was transferred to step-down.

I need to list all these events, split any combined phrases into individual events, and assign the correct timestamps. Also, include all events even if they're mentioned in the discussion. Make sure the timestamps are accurate relative to admission (time 0).
