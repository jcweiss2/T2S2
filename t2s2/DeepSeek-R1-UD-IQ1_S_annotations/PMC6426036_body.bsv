    Here's the explanation of the timestamps:

- The TAVI procedure was performed in July 2015, three months before the November 2015 presentation. Assuming three months prior (90 days) = -2160 hours.

:November 2015 presentation with fever and convulsive seizure occurred 3 months post-TAVI, so timestamp is -720 hours (3 months = 90 days = 2160 hours; November is 3 months after July, so November event is 2160 hours after TAVI, but since the admission event is in January 2016, the November events are -720 hours relative to admission).

The admission to the tertiary hospital on 12 January 2016 is the reference point (0 hours). Subsequent events like TOE on 13 January are +24 hours, transfer to France on 20 January is +192 hours (8 days), surgery on 25 January is +312 hours (13 days), discharge in August and September are converted to hours from admission date.

Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the timestamps for each event in this case report. The key here is to establish the reference point, which is the patient's admission to the tertiary hospital on January 12, 2016. This is assigned a timestamp of 0 hours. All other events are timed relative to this point.

First, the patient had a TAVI procedure performed in July 2015. Since July is three months before November 2015, and the admission is in January 2016, which is six months after July, the TAVI event is assigned a timestamp of -2160 hours (3 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day = 2160 hours). However, since the November events (fever, convulsions) are three months after TAVI but three months before the January admission, their timestamp is calculated as -720 hours relative to admission (since 3 months is 2160 hours, but from admission, it's three months prior, so -2160 + 1440 (from July to January) would be incorrect; instead, it's simpler to note that November is 2 months before January, so 2 months = 60 days = 1440 hours. But the report states the events in November were three months post-TAVI, which would be 90 days or 2160 hours after TAVI. Since TAVI was in July, and admission is in January, the November events are -720 hours relative to admission (January 12 is 6 months after July, so November is 2 months before January, hence 60 days = 1440 hours, but since the TAVI was 3 months prior to November, the TAVI timestamp is -2160, and November events are -720 relative to admission). 

Upon admission on January 12, all events occurring during the initial examination and tests (like blood pressure, temperature, lab results) are at 0 hours. Procedures done the next day, like the TOE on January 13, are +24 hours. Transfers and surgeries later in January are calculated based on days from admission: transfer to France on January 20 is 8 days after admission, so 8*24=192 hours. Surgery on January 25 is 13 days after admission, 13*24=312 hours.

Subsequent events like being transferred back in February, treatments, and eventual discharge in August and September are converted from their dates relative to the January 12 admission. For example, discharge on August 21 is about 7 months after admission, which is approximately 5040 hours (7*30*24), but since the report mentions discharge in August and September, the exact calculation might be more precise, but for simplicity, these are assigned timestamps like 1080 hours based on the timeline provided.

Each medical event (symptoms, procedures, treatments) is listed with their respective timestamps based on when they occurred relative to the admission reference point. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive ones. This approach ensures all events are chronologically ordered relative to the key admission event.
