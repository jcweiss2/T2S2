Sure, let's break down the case report step by step to extract the clinical events and assign the correct timestamps.

First, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes and a bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. She was admitted to the hospital for right otalgia and purulent otorrhea, which started 3 days before admission (assuming 3 days prior is about 72 hours, so timestamp -72). Upon admission (timestamp 0), she was diagnosed with right malignant otitis externa and started on intravenous Augmentin.

The CT scan done 5 days after antibiotics began (5 days is 120 hours) showed bone destruction and osteomyelitis. Infectious disease consult and a 6-week antibiotic regimen with linezolid and piperacillin/tazobactam were initiated at 8 days (192 hours) when she developed severe sepsis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. Cultures identified multi-resistant bacteria and Candida, leading to changes in antibiotics and caspofungin.

Abdominal distension and imaging showing gastric pneumatosis occurred 11 days (264 hours) after admission. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an infarcted stomach, leading to total gastrectomy. Post-surgery, she deteriorated with hypotension and bradycardia, leading to her death 5 days post-surgery (408 hours).

Histopathology confirmed total gastric infarction with mucormycosis, involving arterial and venous invasion. The timeline includes events from admission to death, assigning timestamps based on days converted to hours.
