    Here's the step-by-step explanation:,
    1. **Admission Event (Timestamp 0)**:,
    - The patient was referred to the otorhinolaryngology service of a tertiary hospital on the following day after initial treatment in the Emergency Unit. The admission event is assigned timestamp 0.,
    2. **Events Before Admission**:,
"    - Fever, asthenia, odynophagia, and daily episodes of epistaxis started one week before admission (7 days = -168 hours).",
    - Denial of expelling foreign bodies also occurred before admission (-168 hours).,
    - Cacosmia and foul-smelling nasal crusts for three years (-3 years = -26208 hours).,
"    - Diabetes and hypertension are chronic conditions but are noted on admission, so timestamp 0.",
    3. **Events at Admission (Timestamp 0)**:,
"    - Clinical findings on admission: afebrile, oriented, cooperative, crackles in lungs, mucopurulent secretion in ear, peritonsillar bulging, hyperemia extending to soft palate.",
"    - Initial suspicion of peritonsillar abscess, first puncture, hospitalization, and initiation of antibiotics.",
    4. **Events After Admission**:,
    - Second puncture on the second day (24 hours).,
"    - Subsequent events like septicemia, transfer to ICU, intubation, medication administration, and daily examinations are assigned timestamps relative to admission (24 hours onwards).",
    - Removal of larvae after 72 hours (96 hours) and death on day 30 (720 hours).,
"    By systematically assigning timestamps based on the narrative, the events are organized chronologically to reflect the patient's clinical course.",
