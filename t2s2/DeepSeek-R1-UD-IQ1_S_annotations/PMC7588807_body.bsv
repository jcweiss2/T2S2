**Explanation of Key Timestamps:**

- **Admission to Hospital (0 hours):** The admission event is considered the reference point (0 hours). All events before this have negative timestamps, and events after have positive timestamps.

5. **Smoking History:** The patient had a 43-year smoking history and quit 20 years before presentation. Converted to hours:
   - 43 years ≈ 43 * 365 * 24 = 376,680 hours (not used as it's historical)
   - Quit smoking 20 years ago ≈ 20 * 365 * 24 = 175,200 hours (approximated as -182760 for simplicity)

- **Spindle Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis:** Diagnosed two weeks after admission, so 2 weeks * 168 hours/week = 336 hours.

- **Palliative Measures:** Initiated two weeks after diagnosis, so 336 + 168 = 504 hours.
