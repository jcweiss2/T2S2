Alright, I need to process this case report and extract all the clinical events along with their timestamps. The admission event is at time 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive ones. Since the user provided an example, I need to follow that structure.

First, let's parse the case report step by step. The patient is a 56-year-old man with obesity, a smoker, and occasional alcohol drinker. He was treated at the Hospital Emergency Department. The events start at the Primary Care center where he presented symptoms five days before admission: headache, fever, hearing loss, vomiting, and dysthermic sensation. The onset was after handling and eating roast pork. He received initial treatment with diazepam, metamizole, tramadol, and metoclopramide there. Then he was referred to the hospital for persistent headache.

At admission, the physical exam showed oxygen saturation at 85%, diaphoresis, meningeal signs, and agitation. They did a CT scan and lumbar puncture. The CSF was cloudy. Lab results from blood and CSF were taken here. The patient was admitted to ICU, started on dexamethasone and antibiotics. After 24 hours, the lab identified S. suis, and targeted treatment with cefotaxime began. He stayed in ICU for six days, then moved to Internal Medicine for three weeks. At discharge, he had hearing loss and tinnitus. He was discharged after four weeks on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Now, assigning timestamps. The admission to ICU is at 0. Events at the Primary Care center happened five days before, which is 120 hours before admission, so timestamp -120. Those include headache, fever, hearing loss, etc., and the initial medications. The events during the hospital stay, like CT scan, lumbar puncture, lab results, and starting treatment, are at 0. The lab results after 24 hours would be +24. Moving to Internal Medicine after six days (144 hours) is +144. Discharge after four weeks (672 hours) is +672.

I need to break down combined phrases into separate events. For example, "oppressive holocranial headache of strong intensity" becomes two events: "oppressive holocranial headache" and "strong intensity", both at -120. Also, the handling and intake of pork are separate but same timestamp. Each treatment given at Primary Care is separate events. All findings during admission are timestamp 0. Post-admission events like lab results, ICU stay duration, and discharge follow their respective times.

I have to make sure not to omit any events, even negative findings like normal CT scan. Include pertinent negatives if present. Also, include all treatments and their timings. The hearing loss at admission is 0, and the exacerbation later is also 0 since it's noted during admission. Discharge and follow-up are at +672.

I'll list each event with its timestamp, ensuring the format is two columns separated by a pipe. Each event on its own row. Double-check for any missed events and their correct timestamps based on the description.
