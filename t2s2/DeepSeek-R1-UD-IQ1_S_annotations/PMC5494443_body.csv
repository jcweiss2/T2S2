"Alright, let me try to parse through this case report. The patient is a 10-week-old male infant presenting with abdominal distension and lethargy. The mother reported symptoms starting three days prior: fever, poor feeding, and vomiting. Then one day before admission, the infant's condition worsened with cessation of bowel movements, progressive abdominal distension, irritability, and then lethargy.",
"First, the admission event is at time 0. So, any events that happened before admission need negative timestamps based on how far back they occurred. The fever, poor feeding, and vomiting started three days before admission, which is 72 hours prior. So those get a timestamp of -72. The deterioration (cessation of bowel movements, progressive abdominal distension, irritability) happened one day before admission, so that's -24 hours.",
"Upon admission, the physical exam findings like being afebrile, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, oxygen saturation, and physical signs (distended abdomen, dehydration, etc.) are all at time 0. The lab results and imaging findings (like multiple air fluid levels) also occur at admission, so they're timestamp 0.",
"The surgery happens after admission, so events like ileal perforation, repair, biopsies, appendectomy, ileostomy would be at 0 or shortly after. Since the timeline isn't specified beyond the admission, I'll assign them 0. The post-surgery complications like cardiopulmonary arrest at 8 and 20 hours would be +8 and +20, but since the final death is at 24 hours, that's +24.",
"I need to make sure all events are captured, including negatives like no family history of HD, no congenital disorders, delayed meconium passage, etc. These are part of the history taken at admission, so timestamp 0.",
"I might have missed some events, so I should scan the report again. The baby's birth details: small for gestational age, weight at birth, vaccination statusâ€”all part of the history, so timestamp 0. The diagnosis of Hirschsprung's is made during surgery, so timestamp 0. The death occurs 24 hours after admission, so +24.",
"Alright, I think that covers most events. Now, I'll structure them into the table with events and timestamps.",
