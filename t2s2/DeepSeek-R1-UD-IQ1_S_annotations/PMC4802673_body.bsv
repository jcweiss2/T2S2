  Here is the step-by-step explanation to create the table:

1. **Identify the admission event**: The patient was admitted to the ICU for septic shock occurring thirteen days after surgery. Assign timestamp 0 to "admitted to ICU" and "septic shock" at -312 hours (13 days * 24 hours/day = 312 hours prior to admission).

2. **Extract patient demographics**: The patient is 58 years old and male, timestamped at 0.

3. **Chronic conditions**: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are present on admission, timestamp 0.

4. **Procedures and treatments upon admission**: Invasive mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine infusion started at admission, timestamp 0.

5. **Time-sensitive events**: Central venous catheter (CVC) was placed 6 days before admission, which is -144 hours (6 days * 24).

6. **Diagnostic tests and findings**: Culture samples, CT scan, echocardiography, etc., were done at admission, timestamp 0.

7. **Treatment changes**: Antibiotics started at admission (vancomycin, imipenem, colistin). When resistance was found, these were stopped (timestamp 0), and amikacin with increased imipenem started. CVVHDF began 1 hour after amikacin, so timestamp 1.

8. **Outcomes and discharge**: Norepinephrine stopped 5 days after treatment change (120 hours). Discharge from ICU occurred 4 days after therapy end (total 14 days treatment + 4 days = 18 days = 432 hours).

9. **Include all events**: Even discussion points like high mortality, treatment strategies are included with timestamp 0 as they relate to admission context.

By systematically parsing each event and assigning timestamps based on relation to admission (0), we create a comprehensive timeline.
