"Alright, so I'm trying to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. First, I'll need to read through the case report carefully to identify all the events mentioned. The events include medical conditions, procedures, symptoms, treatments, and any complications or changes in condition over time.",
"The case report starts by introducing a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and auricular fibrillation. He was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon stage T4aN1M0. The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration, which showed a perforated neoplasm. The procedure was converted to open surgery, and a total oncologic colectomy with ileo-rectal stapled anastomosis was performed. These initial events are likely to have a timestamp of 0 since they're part of the admission or the main procedure.",
"Forty-eight hours later, the patient experienced self-limited abdominal bleeding probably due to high dose of LMWH. At the same time, hiccups appeared. The hiccups initially responded to haloperidol and chlorpromazine but later became uncontrollable. A CT scan was done, showing no intraabdominal complications, and the patient was admitted to the ICU. These events happen 48 hours after the surgery, so their timestamp is 48.",
"Then, during the next days, fever peaks started. Bacteraemia related to the CVC was diagnosed, along with inflammatory signs on the right jugular venous access. A cervicothoracic CT revealed a thrombus and air bubbles in the right jugular vein, causing dilatation near the phrenic nerve. Since these events happened ""during the next days"" after ICU admission, which was at 48 hours, I'll assume they occurred a day later, adding 24 hours, making it 72 hours.",
"The diagnosis of persistent hiccups secondary to septic thrombosis led to treatment with LMWH and antibiotics. Catheter removal was considered but not done initially. One week later (168 hours), the patient was discharged from ICU to the surgery ward. Then, during the next days, isolated fever peaks occurred, which disappeared after catheter removal. Assuming ""next days"" after discharge from ICU would be around 24 hours later, so 168 + 24 = 192 hours for the fever peaks and catheter removal.",
"Finally, a 3-week intravenous antibiotic cycle was performed, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. 3 weeks is 504 hours, so discharge would be at 504 hours.",
"I need to make sure I've captured all events, including pertinent negatives if mentioned. The case report mentions the absence of intraabdominal complications, which should be noted at 48 hours. Also, the catheter removal being considered but not done initially, which is at 72 hours.",
"Let me check if there are any other events I might have missed. The introduction mentions complications like pneumothorax, infection, thrombosis, but hiccup is rare. However, in the case report, the main events are the hiccups, septic thrombosis, treatments, etc. The discussion section may have more info, but the user instructed to focus on the case report part, not the discussion.",
"I think I've covered all events in the case report. Now, organizing them into the required format with timestamps. Each event is separated, and conjunctive phrases are split into individual events with the same timestamp.",
