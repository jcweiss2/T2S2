    Let's analyze the case step by step.

First, the patient is a 52-year-old woman admitted to the hospital. The initial events at admission are timestamped 0. Her presenting symptoms include worsening shortness of breath, treated as heart failure exacerbation. An echocardiogram shows several findings: dilated aortic root, bicuspid aortic valve, moderate mixed aortic valve disease, and mild mitral regurgitation. These are all timestamp 0 as they are part of the admission assessment.

Her medical history includes a Bentall’s procedure and mitral valve annuloplasty. Since the surgery occurred 12 months before admission, we convert that to hours: 12 months * 30 days/month * 24 hours/day = 8760 hours. However, the case states she re-presented 4 years later. So, 4 years is 4*365*24 = 35040 hours. But since she had the Bentall procedure 4 years prior, that would be -35040 hours. However, the case mentions that the sternotomy wound healed in 12 months after surgery, which is 8760 hours, so that's -8760. Then she re-presented 4 years after the Bentall procedure with a discharging sternal sinus. So four years after the surgery is 4*365*24=35040 hours, but since the admission is timestamp 0, this event would be at -35040 hours. However, the case says she had the Bentall procedure, then 4 years later presented with the sternal sinus. So the Bentall procedure is 4 years before the admission, which is -35040 hours. The sternal wound healed 12 months after surgery, which is -8760 hours relative to the Bentall procedure, but since the Bentall was 4 years ago, the sternal wound healing would be at -35040 + 8760 = -26280 hours. But the case states that the sternal wound healed 12 months after surgery, which is a separate event, but in the timeline, the admission is at 0, so the Bentall procedure is 4 years before admission, which is -35040 hours. The sternal wound healing is 12 months after the Bentall, so 12 months is 8760 hours, so relative to admission, that's -35040 + 8760 = -26280 hours. However, the case states that the sternotomy wound had healed in the 12 months after surgery, which is a past event, so it's -8760 hours from the time of the Bentall procedure. But since the Bentall procedure itself is 4 years before admission, the sternal wound healing would be 4 years minus 12 months = 3 years before admission, which is -26280 hours. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the Bentall procedure was done 4 years prior to the current admission, and the sternotomy wound healed 12 months after that surgery, so the healing occurred 3 years before the current admission. So 3 years is 3*365*24=26280 hours, so timestamp is -26280. However, in the case report, the timeline is:

- Bentall procedure (4 years before admission: -35040 hours)
