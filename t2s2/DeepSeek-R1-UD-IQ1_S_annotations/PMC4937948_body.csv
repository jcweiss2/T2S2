    beta# 网络拓扑结构,
## 网络结构图,
![网络结构图](NetworkTopology.png),
## 网络结构说明,
网络结构中存在四个服务器，两个服务器位于内网，两个位于公网。其中，公网的服务器有两个：一个用于运行主程序（如网站服务），另一个用于代理服务器；内网的两台服务器，一台用于数据库，另一台用于缓存。,
## 访问流程说明,
用户通过访问代理服务器来获取服务。代理服务器作为入口，将请求分发到内网的主程序服务器。主程序在处理请求时，根据需要会访问缓存服务器或数据库服务器。这种结构确保了主程序服务器不直接暴露于公网，提高了安全性。同时，代理服务器还可能承担负载均衡和流量管理的职责。,
