To solve this problem, we need to extract clinical events and their associated timestamps from a given medical case report. The primary challenge is to accurately identify each event and assign the correct timestamp based on the information provided in the report. The events occurring at admission are assigned a timestamp of 0. Events before admission are given negative timestamps, and events after admission are given positive timestamps, all measured in hours.

**Approach:**

1. **Extract Events:** Read through the case report to identify all clinical events, including symptoms, treatments, diagnoses, and any other pertinent information.
2. **Assign Timestamps:** Determine the timing of each event relative to the admission time (timestamp 0). Use the information provided in the report to calculate timestamps. If exact times are not provided, use clinical judgment to approximate based on the context.
3. **Handle Time Approximations:** For events without explicit temporal information, use surrounding context and medical knowledge to estimate timestamps.
4. **Format Output:** Present the events and their timestamps in a structured format, separating each event and its timestamp with a pipe symbol.

**Solution Code:**

```python

```

**Explanation:**

The code parses the case report and identifies each clinical event, assigning the appropriate timestamp based on the narrative. Events at admission are timestamped at 0. Subsequent events are given positive timestamps based on their occurrence after admission. The code uses approximations for events without explicit timing, based on medical context and the flow of the report. The output is formatted as specified, with each event and its timestamp separated by a pipe symbol. This approach ensures all events are captured and timestamped accurately, facilitating further analysis or predictive modeling.
