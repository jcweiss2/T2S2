Note: The discharge event is not mentioned in the case report, so I put a timestamp of -1 to indicate that it is not available. If you want to remove it, I can do that. 

Also, note that some events have the same timestamp because they happen at the same time or the text does not provide a specific time for each event. 

Let me know if you need any further changes.
