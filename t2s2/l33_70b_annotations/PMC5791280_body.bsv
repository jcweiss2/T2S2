Note: The timestamp for "discharged" is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but based on the context, it is likely that the patient was discharged after the issue with the ETT was resolved, so I have assigned a timestamp of -1 hour, assuming it happened shortly after the events described. However, this is an approximation and the actual timestamp may vary.
