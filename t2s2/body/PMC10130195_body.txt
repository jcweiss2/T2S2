pmc1 Introduction

Mesenchymal neoplasms arise in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and compose of different types named according to the cell type they resemble. Mesenchymal neoplasms are a rare entity, and the most common mesenchymal tumor in the abdomen is the gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GISTs) [1]. Approximately >50 % of GISTs are located in the stomach, 30 % in the small intestine, 10 % in the jejunum, and are rarely found elsewhere in the GIT [1], [2], [3]. GISTs usually present due to a mass effect or as an emergency (i.e. acute abdomen) [1]. In jejunal GISTs, they can present with a palpable mass or symptoms secondary to obstruction, seldom necrosis or ulceration followed by perforation [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].

GISTs arise from the intestinal Cajal cells in the muscularis propria, which act as the pacemaker for intestinal peristalsis and express c-KIT. GISTs share phenotypic similarities with the Cajal cells, in which they express gain-of-function mutation of the gene encoding tyrosine kinase c-KIT [1], [2]. They could also express another mutation related to tyrosine kinase activation, known as platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA). Either mutation is sufficient for tumorigenesis. Primary GISTs present as a solitary submucosal mass, and metastasis may form multiple serosal or liver nodules [1]. Although spread to the outside of the abdomen is rare, GISTs described as elongated spindle cells or plumper epithelioid cells [9]. The definitive diagnostic tool is immunohistochemistry in detecting CD117, which is a part of the KIT tyrosine kinase receptors [1], [10]. The standard imaging technique is a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast, allowing to stage the tumor and assess the presence of disseminated or metastatic disease. PET scan can be considered in selected patients, and it is highly sensitive in detecting systemic therapy responses [11].

The main goal for the treatment of localized tumors is complete surgical resection with a negative margin [2], [3]. The prognosis depends on size, mitotic index, and location. Patients with unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent GISTs are often selected for tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors such as imatinib; unfortunately, they soon become resistant to imatinib [2]. Those patients should be managed by dose escalation or switching to second-line treatment with sunitinib.

This case report has been produced in keeping with the SCARE criteria [12].

2 Case presentation

A 50-year-old female with a history of celiac disease associated with iron deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism was admitted to the medical ward with a complaint of chronic febrile illness associated with drenching night sweats. This complaint was attributed to a recent endoscopic finding of fungal esophagitis, treated with antifungal medication. The patient reported frequent nausea with no vomiting episodes and normal bowel motion. Upon investigation, a CT scan showed an incidental finding of a tumor (9.2 × 8.2 × 12.1 cm) associated with liver lesions, and mild pericardial effusion (Fig. 1). Echocardiogram was unremarkable with normal ejection fraction. A tissue biopsy from the liver lesion revealed the diagnosis of GIST. The patient was referred to a medical oncologist for systemic therapy.Fig. 1 A coronal view of the abdomen/pelvis contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a 9.2 × 8.2 × 12.1 cm mass with an exophytic component in the jejunum (black arrow), associated with liver metastasis (red arrow).

The patient started imatinib 400 mg daily for three months. During this time, the patient was complaining of generalized fatigability and symptomatic anemia secondary to a bleeding tumor, requiring multiple times of transfusions. A follow-up CT scan revealed the progression of the tumor, and the patient was started on second-line treatment, sunitinib. During her hospital stay the patient underwent echocardiography due to persistent tachycardia which revealed small pericardial effusion and high ejection fraction (>65 %). Shortly after, the patient presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain, multiple episodes of vomiting, and no bowel motion for more than two days. The patient was tachycardic, tachypneic and maintained oxygenation on a nasal cannula. Examination revealed significant generalized abdominal tenderness associated with guarding and a rigid abdomen. A significant rise in lactate level, with unremarkable laboratory test. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia.

The patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and revealed ischemic changes in the jejunal loops and pneumoperitoneum (Fig. 2). The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy. Upon entrance to the peritoneal cavity, a gush of turbid intraperitoneal fluid came out. Exploration of the abdomen revealed a large mass, arising from the mid-jejunum. The mass was adherent to the surrounding bowels. Upon running the bowel, there was evidence of perforation, and a considerably edematous bowel was noted (Fig. 3). The mass and part of the small bowel were resected (about 50 cm long), located approximately 250 cm from the duodenojejunal (DJ) junction, with side-to-side anastomosis. During the procedure, the patient had episodes of hypotension despite resuscitation. With the knowledge of the previous mild pericardial effusion, an intraoperative pericardial window was created and around 200 mL of serous fluid was drained, and the condition improved. Multiple intraperitoneal drains were inserted, and the abdomen was closed. The patient was extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative monitoring.Fig. 2 Axial and coronal views of abdomen/pelvis contrast-enhanced CT scan showing ischemic changes in jejunal loops (black arrow) and pneumoperitoneum (white arrow).

Postoperatively, the patient was commenced on trials of adjuvant third and fourth lines of chemotherapy regimens (Regorafenib and Pazopanib), which was unsuccessful. The patient's condition deteriorated due to presence of liver metastasis and the occurrence of obstructive phenomena. Thus, the patient required percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). Due to the advance stage of the disease and the poor prognosis it carries, the patient unfortunately passed away.

The histopathological examination of the specimen revealed it to be GIST measured 12X11X9cm. The mitotic activity rate was 11 MF/50 HPF. Safety margins were confirmed (Fig. 4). The number of lymph nodes was one negative mesenteric lymph node.Fig. 4 Hematoxylin and eosin stained section showing gastrointestinal stromal tumor composed of spindle cell proliferation in intersecting fascicles with mild cytologic atypia and eosinophilic cytoplasm (a). There were areas with a gradual transition into high-grade morphology “anaplastic features” including increased cellularity, marked nuclear atypia, increased mitosis and necrosis (b). The tumor cells were immunoreactive to CD117 (c) and DOG1 (d). These immunostains reactivity is decreased to absent in the high-grade anaplastic areas.

3 Discussion

GISTs are the most common type of mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen [1]. Approximately 10 % of abdominal GISTs are located in the Jejunum. Jejunal GIST is considered to be rare and difficult to diagnose due to its non-specific presentation. Those patients usually suffer from abdominal pain, early satiety, abdominal fullness, or palpable mass. Nevertheless, they can also present with symptoms secondary to hemorrhage, or rarely perforation. A definitive diagnosis of GISTs requires histopathological examination of the specimen [9]. Almost most of the GISTs express CD117 (tyrosine kinase receptor) [10].

Management of GISTs depends upon the size and mitotic activity. Primary non-metastatic resectable GISTs are treated surgically. However, metastatic or unresectable GISTs require systemic therapy followed by surgery [2], [3]. In our case, the size was large yet there was no harvested positive lymph node. Since the rarity of lymph node metastasis, lymphadenectomy is not routinely conducted [13]. Patient clinical outcome is considered dismal when accompanied by necrosis, perforation, or metastasis. Currently, most of the perforated GISTs are located in the jejunum and are considered to be high-risk malignant GISTs.

Our patient presented with acute abdomen due to perforated jejunal GIST, requiring emergency surgery with resection of the mass and stapler side-to-side jejunojejunostomy anastomosis. As well as the creation of a pericardial window due to hemodynamic instability.

In the literature, TKI treatment showed the development of pericardial effusion, which could be a life-threatening complication. Although reported cases of TKI-related effusions mostly associated with pleural effusion, concurrent or isolated pericardial effusion have been reported as well. [14]. According to treatment guidelines, it is recommended to monitor cardiac function in patients with cardiovascular risk factors during the treatment. Our patient had an echocardiogram with normal echocardiogram prior to treatment. This illustrates the importance of close cardiac monitoring for patients who are commenced on TKI treatment [15].

Final pathology revealed classical GIST with the presence of positive c-KIT. According to AJCC, GIST staging is based on tumor size (T), lymph node invasion (N), metastasis (M), and mitotic activity (Table 1). Thus, and due to the size of the tumor (12 cm), high mitotic activity (11 mitotic figures per 50 high power field), and the presence of metastatic liver lesions, this is consistent with pT4N0M1 or stage IV GIST.Table 1 AJCC Staging of jejunal gastrointestinal tumor.

Eventually, jejunal GIST are exceptionally rare and usually patients present as an emergency. On these limited occasions, patients usually present in an advance stage which makes the management challenging and the prognosis unfavorable.

4 Conclusion

The presentation of perforated malignant jejunal GIST causing diffuse secondary peritonitis is rare in the literature. Emergency surgical resection is required due to severe sepsis and peritonitis. In this case, we were able to perform complete resection with a negative margin. As seen in previously reported cases, jejunal GISTs are surgically challenging due to their anatomical complexity. In metastatic or unresectable diseases, systemic therapy is the primary treatment. For patients who are on TKI treatment, close cardiac monitoring is warranted to avoid TKI-related pericardial effusion.
