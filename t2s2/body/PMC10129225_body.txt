Highlights

This case report highlights the life-threatening nature of glyphosate poisoning.

Aggressive treatment and careful monitoring of complications are required, particularly in patients at risk of capillary leakage syndrome.

Early application of continuous renal replacement therapy, plasma infusion, and ulinastatin is beneficial in alleviating the symptoms of capillary leakage.

The Monsanto Company first developed glyphosate under the commercial name, Roundup in 1974. It has become the most widely used broad-spectrum herbicide in modern agriculture1. Self-poisoning with glyphosate is rare in rural China. Oral ingestion of polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA), a component of Roundup, can induce gastrointestinal disturbances. In severe cases, poisoning can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, renal failure, and even death2. A variety of diseases such as sepsis, engraftment syndrome, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and ricin poisoning can result in capillary leak syndrome, which is manifested as acute renal failure, systemic edema, and exudative serous cavity effusions. There have been no other reports of acute poisoning-induced capillary leak syndrome3. We present a case of Roundup poisoning in a patient who developed capillary-leak syndrome, severe metabolic acidosis, and shock. Substantial improvement of capillary leakage was observed after initiation of early continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), plasma infusion, and application of ulinastatin. This case report has been reported in line with the Surgical CAse REport 2020 checklist4.

Case description

A 69-year-old female patient (64 kg) was admitted to the emergency department within 2 h after oral ingestion of ∼300 ml Roundup (41% glyphosate + 15% POEA). The patient was somatically healthy, without prior psychiatric illnesses, and free from any substance abuse disorder. She had an argument for financial reasons before she was poisoned. She presented with vomiting and lethargy. The patient was conscious and disoriented on physical examination regarding person, place, and time. Furthermore, she had a Glasgow coma scale of 12, blood pressure (BP) of 91/56 mm Hg, and SpO2 of 91% in room air. Tenderness throughout the abdomen was observed. The results of other systemic examinations were unremarkable.

Gastric lavage was performed immediately. The patient was then transferred to the emergency ICU, hydrated with normal saline, and correction of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a serum lactate level elevated to 19.1 mmol/l (Table 1). Hemoperfusion was initiated. Six hours later, the patient’s consciousness level decreased, and she required ventilatory support. Vasoactive support was needed due to a drop in BP. On auxiliary examination, the patient’s total leukocyte count was high (Table 2). Biochemical analysis revealed the following: creatinine, 122 μmol/l; glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, 212 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 307 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 113 1IU/l; and creatine kinase, 246 U/l (Table 2).

The patient developed uncontrolled seizures 8 h after admission. Arterial blood gas revealed elevated lactate levels and worsening metabolic acidosis. Even after administering multiple high-dose vasoactive agents (norepinephrine 16 µg/kg/min; metaraminol bitartrate 3 µg/kg/min), structured fat emulsion injection (C6–24 50 g/day), and a large amount of fluid, the patient’s BP remained low. Reexamination revealed the following (Table 2): hemoglobin, 185 g/l; hematocrit (0.55 l/l); serum creatinine, 164 mg/dl; total protein, 59.6 g/l; albumin, 31.6 g/l; glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, 1012 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase, 570 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 2152 IU/l; C-reactive protein, 134.7 mg/l; creatine kinase, 7201 U/l; myoglobin, greater than 3769 ng/ml; interleukin (IL)-6, 7411 pg/ml; IL-10, 37.4 pg/ml. Computed tomography indicated pulmonary effusion (Fig. 1), massive fluid accumulation in the intestinal wall and lumen, and edema in the interstitial spaces (Fig. 2). These findings suggest the development of capillary leak syndrome3. CRRT was initiated to mitigate capillary leakage at 8 h. After infusion of large amounts of plasma (1000 ml), albumin, small doses of glucocorticoids, and ulinastatin (0.4 million every 8 h), urine output increased, and BP gradually stabilized. CRRT was discontinued after 3 days. The patient was extubated after 7 days and transferred out of the intensive care unit after 10 days. The patient was discharged after 20 days and had no abnormal signs and symptoms at 3 months with a telephone consultation.

Discussion

Glyphosate was thought to have a low risk of poisoning, although it had no antidote. In this case report, we found that severe glyphosate-surfactant herbicide (GlySH) poisoning may lead to capillary leakage syndrome and aggravate renal failure, shock, and even death. In the present cases and literature, capillary leakage caused by poisoning was not observed. We suggest that early assessment of capillary leakage syndrome and early intervention, including plasma infusion and CRRT therapy, may be protective against refractory shock and renal failure.

Glyphosate is used widely in agriculture. Formulation products such as POEA may enhance glyphosate toxicity by facilitating cellular entry5. Surfactant intake is a primary determinant of GlySH poisoning severity6,7. Approximately 30–60% of glyphosate is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, and the peak serum concentration occurs 6 h after dosing8. Glyphosate is not metabolized in the body to a great extent. It is excreted unchanged, primarily, via the feces and secondarily in the urine. The following prognostic factors are useful for predicting GlySH mortality: age more than 59 years, abnormal chest radiography, corrected QT interval greater than 495 ms, metabolic acidosis, lactate level greater than 4.7 mmol/l, elevated Cr level, and tachycardia9,10. Quick sequential organ failure assessment and sequential organ failure assessment score are associated with rates of life-threatening complications and can be used to predict outcomes11,12.

The patient developed an acute kidney injury upon admission and presented with anuria despite fluid loading. Hypovolemic shock and mitochondrial respiration were attributed to acute kidney injury. The renal proximal tubule, a mitochondria-abundant nephron segment, is the primary target of injury. A prior case report demonstrated shunting of renal blood flow through the medulla13. Histological examination has also revealed tubular injury, especially in the proximal tubule14.

GlySH poisoning leads to a ‘sepsis-like’ syndrome, generating neutrophils and mobilizing the rapid release of several cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10. Inflammation can cause protein-rich plasma leakage and increase capillary permeability, resulting in hemodynamic compromise. Consequently, systemic capillary leak syndrome is developed3,15. This case report may supplement the existing literature as follows, clinical manifestations of systemic capillary leak syndrome included hemoconcentration, increased hematocrit, hypoalbuminemia, interstitial fluid accumulation, and refractory hypotension. Substantial improvement of capillary leakage was observed only gradually after initiation of early CRRT, plasma infusion, and application of ulinastatin.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this case report highlights the life-threatening nature of glyphosate poisoning. Currently, there are no antidotes for GlySH poisoning. Therefore, aggressive treatment and careful monitoring of complications are required, particularly in patients at risk of capillary leakage syndrome.
