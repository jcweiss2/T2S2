pmc1 Introduction

Solid organ transplant recipients (SOT) have a higher risk of developing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to immunosuppressive therapy [1]. Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic IFI caused by encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcosis is the third most common IFI after Candida and Aspergillus in SOT recipients [2], with a reported incidence of 0.3%–5.0%, and overall mortality rate of 33%–42% [3,4].

Cryptococcosis incidence varies among different organ transplant recipients, with renal transplant recipients being the most commonly affected group. Cryptococcosis has a variable clinical presentation and can range from subclinical colonization to severe disseminated disease [1]. The most commonly affected site in transplant recipients is central nervous system followed by pulmonary, cutaneous, prostate, bone, liver, and kidney. Cryptococcal meningitis, pulmonary cryptococcosis and disseminated cryptococcosis are associated with poor outcomes in transplant patients [5]. Furthermore, studies have reported that presence of cryptococcemia is associated with high mortality rate [6]. Therefore, early diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and management of complications are essential for improving outcomes in transplant patients.

We report a case of a 31-year-old female patient with pancreas-kidney transplant who developed cryptococcemia while being treated for suspected catheter related blood stream infection.

2 Case presentation

A 31-year-old female, who underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant 9 years ago in China due to advanced diabetic nephropathy leading to End stage renal disease. Patient has chronic renal graft dysfunction and was initiated on regular hemodialysis in 2018 via a PermCath. Patient was on immunosuppressive therapy (mycophenolate 180 mg tab twice daily, tacrolimus 3 mg tab twice daily, and prednisolone 5 mg tab once daily). Patient presented to hemodialysis unit Ibrahim Bin Hamad Obaidallah Hospital, Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates with fever, shortness of breath and dry cough for 3 days. Patient had shivering during her dialysis session with high-grade fever. She was admitted as a case of suspected catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI). Her past medical history was notable for type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease, hypertension, bronchial asthma, glaucoma and depression.

On admission (Day 0), patient was alert and oriented in mild chest discomfort more on right side with a temperature of 39.4 °C, pulse of 112 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min with room air oxygen saturation of 90% and a blood pressure of 138/75 mmHg. Laboratory evaluations revealed white blood cells (WBC) 9.44 × 103/μL, red blood cells (RBC) 3.46 × 106/mcL, hemoglobin (Hb) 9.0 g/dL, neutrophils 86%, lymphocytes 8%, absolute neutrophil count 7.17 × 103/mcL, red cell distribution width (RDW) 18.0, serum creatinine 541 μmol/L, urea 11.66 mmol/L, potassium 4.85 mmol/L, sodium 139 mmol/L, phosphorus 2.24 mmol/L and eGFR 8.4 mL/min/1.73 m2, total protein 51 g/L, albumin 23.3 g/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 78.0 mg/L, procalcitonin 3.25 μg/L and D-dimer 1.40 mg/L. random blood sugar 7.5 mmol/L and HbA1C 6.7%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH 7.349, pCO2 40.9 mmHg, pO2 115.4 mmHg and HCO3 22.0 mmol/L. Her chest CT revealed widespread diffuse patchy areas of ground glass veiling and air space consolidations mixed with areas of strandy reticulo-nodular infiltrates scattered at both lung lobes (Fig. 1). Her chest x-ray showed bilateral extensive multifocal pulmonary opacities (Fig. 2A). Considering line related sepsis, immunosuppressive treatment was curtailed (Tacrolimus 2 mg twice daily was continued mycophenolate 180 mg twice daily was withheld, prednisolone was increased to 20 mg/day), empiric antibiotic therapy (vancomycin 1 g every 48 h, meropenem 500 mg every 24 h and amikacin 400 mg every 48 hours) was initiated and the patient continue to have her regular hemodialysis sessions. RT-PCR for COVID-19 and Blood culture were sent on the day of admission (Day 0) and results returned negative on day 1 and day 3 respectively. Pulmonology team was consulted and advised for bronchoscopy but patient refused the procedure.Fig. 1 CT chest showing bilateral extensive multifocal opacities.

On Day 7 of admission, post-dialysis the patient had chills, shivering, high-grade fever and was desaturating on 15L non-rebreather mask (NRBM), with a saturation of 82–83% following which she was put on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The patient was shifted to intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. In ICU, patient was shifted to non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and given hemodialysis. Repeat blood, sputum cultures and TB workup were sent. Despite the initial improvement, the patient’s oxygen requirements increased, and her chest x-ray showed bilateral extensive multi-lobar air space filling and ground glass opacities.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient was on regular hemodialysis and her condition improved and alternated between non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and HFNC. Blood, sputum cultures and TB screen were negative. Bronchoscopy with bronchial lavage for a better diagnosis was discussed again with the patient and her family, but they refused. In view of the worsening chest x-ray with negative blood cultures, patient was started empirically on Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX 1200 mg daily) on day 8 and vancomycin and meropenem was stopped. The patient improved clinically on TMP/SMX and chest x-ray also showed some improvement. The patient sputum analysis using polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) revealed positive results for Pneumocystis jirovecii.

On Day 15 of admission, patient developed high-grade fever and her condition deteriorated. Pan-culture was sent and vancomycin and meropenem were restarted. Preliminary results from the blood culture sent on the Day 12 revealed the presence of yeast cells, prompting the initiation of anidulafungin with an initial loading dose of 200mg, followed by a maintenance dose of 100mg daily. Concurrently, the patient became more tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 40/min, and developed severe respiratory distress. A follow up chest X-ray was done revealing extensive bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities encompassing both lungs and obscured costophrenic angles (Fig. 2B). No neurological symptoms were observed Subsequently, she developed severe hypoxemia in spite of NIV and became unresponsive. She was intubated and was put on mechanical ventilation. However, within few hours she developed bradycardia followed by asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated as per advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and the patient died after 30 minutes. The final result from the blood culture sent on Day 12 came out positive for Cryptococcus neoformans on Day 20 (5 days after patient death).

3 Discussion

Cryptococcemia is a rare but serious condition that can occur in immunocompromised patients, particularly solid organ transplant recipients. We presented a case of cryptococcemia in a pancreas-kidney transplant patient.

A study conducted by Jean el al. identified solid organ transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy as susceptible group for cryptococcal diseases. Furthermore, the study revealed high acute high mortality rates in cryptococcemia patients with more than 10% of the patients dying before the availability of culture results [6]. Few case reports have described cryptococcemia in solid organ transplant patients [7,8].

In solid organ transplant patients, Cryptococcus neoformans infection usually occurs in the late post-transplantation period, typically over 12 months after the transplantation. Primary acquisition upon transplantation or reactivation of a dormant infection are two possible causes of this infection [8,9]. In our case, the infection appeared five years after transplantation. The cause of the infection could be attributed to the reactivation of a dormant infection or primary infection.

Immunosuppressive therapy, which includes glucocorticoids, is administered to transplant recipients to reduce the risk of organ rejection. However, glucocorticoids also reduce cellular immunity, increasing the risk of Cryptococcus neoformans infection. On the other hand, mycophenolate and tacrolimus have reported to have activity against Cryptococcus neoformans [8,10]. Our patient was on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate. Considering line sepsis, we curtailed the immunosuppressive treatment in our patient, tacrolimus dose was reduced and mycophenolate was withdrawn, which may have increased the risk of Cryptococcus neoformans infection.

Cryptococcemia presents a diagnostic challenge given its often non-specific clinical manifestation that can mimic other infections [1]. In our patient, the initial suspicion leaned towards a catheter-related bloodstream infection. Furthermore, absence of the characteristic neurological symptoms typically associated with cryptococcal infections in our patient added another layer of diagnostic uncertainty. This ambiguity was exacerbated by elevated septic markers, including procalcitonin, which typically indicate a bacterial infection, thus further obscuring the underlying diagnosis of cryptococcemia. Such complexities in the clinical presentation emphasize the importance of robust diagnostic tools. Culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis and fungemia. However, obtaining definitive results through culture can be a time-consuming process, often taking up to a week, as was the case in our patient. Alternative diagnostic methods include multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex-PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS). Nonetheless, while potentially faster and more accurate, these techniques are expensive and not widely available. In the context of our patient's ambiguous clinical presentation, compounded by her immunosuppressive status and the possible presence of multiple coexisting infections, the need for broad-spectrum antifungal coverage became paramount. Consequently, anidulafungin was incorporated into the therapeutic regimen. However, it is important to emphasize that echinocandins, such as anidulafungin, do not serve as first-line agents in the management of cryptococcal disease [11]. Guidelines advocate for a combination therapy of amphotericin B and flucytosine as the cornerstone of initial cryptococcemia management [12]. Nonetheless, in challenging clinical scenarios marked by critically ill patients and pending definitive diagnostic resolutions, the interim deployment of broad-spectrum agents like anidulafungin becomes a judicious clinical choice.
