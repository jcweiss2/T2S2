pmcIntroduction

Albendazole and praziquantel are broad-spectrum drugs which are used for the treatment of many parasitic infections, including cysticercosis,tapeworm disease and clonorchiasis. We treated a 45-year-old Chinese man with albendazole and praziquantel for CE. The patient experienced many adverse reactions including diarrhea, stomachache, increase bilirubin and fatal pancytopenia during the treatment. We analyzed the possible causes for this outcome and performed a literature review.

Case description

A 45-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine on May 16, 2022. He had been diagnosed with hepatic echinococcosis with right abdominal distension pain 8 years ago and pulmonary echinococcosis 5 years ago. The patient had been treated with surgery 6 years ago. He was admitted to the hospital to treat pulmonary hypertension and evaluate the surgery time needed to completely clear the CE. Computerized tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showed that the filling defects of the pulmonary artery were not resolved (Fig. 1.). During admission, the patient’s peripheral blood cells（PBC） and bilirubin (TBIL) was normal. The patient was prescribed enoxaparin 4000 IU twice a day for pulmonary embolism, torsemide 10 mg once a day with spironolactone 20 mg once a day to reduce edema. From May 18 th to June 8 th, 2022, the patient was prescribed albendazole（Tianjin Smith Kline &French Laboratorles Ltd） 400 mg twice a day, and praziquantel 600 mg（Hongqi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd） once a day was added from May 26 th to June 8 th, 2022 to enhance the therapeutic effect. On May 23th,2022, the patients total bilirubin increased two times (from 30.32 umol/L to 65.94 umol/L). The blood counts showed severe myelosuppression on June 7, 2022, including WBC 1.35 × 109/L, NEUT 0.73 × 109/L, and Hgb 97 g/L. At the same time, the patient experienced febrile, diarrhea, stomachache, and severe hair loss. The patient’s blood count further decreased with WBC 0.46 × 109/L, NEUT 0.13 × 109/L, and Hgb 88 g/L on June 9th, 2022. Doctors stopped albendazole and praziquantel immediately and treated with parenteral nutrition, omeprazole, glutathione, meropenem and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The gastrointestinal tract reaction recovered gradually. But the PBC was still very low, including WBC 0.86 × 109/L, NEUT 0.25 × 109/L, PLT 78 × 109/L, and Hgb 92 g/L. The patient got very high risk for severe infection.Fortunately, after 8 days of stopping albendazole and praziquantel,the patient PBC began to increase slowly. The changes in the blood count and the doses of the drugs used for treating CE are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively.Fig. 1 Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography(CTPA). The trunk of the pulmonary artery widened and pulmonary artery branches as subsegmental or segmental filled defects.

Discussion

Echinococcus granulosus infection is initially asymptomatic and may remain so for many years. Its subsequent clinical features and complications depend on the size of the cyst(s) and their location. The liver and lungs are affected in approximately 67 % and 25 % of cases, respectively. Most patients experience single-organ involvement, and a single cyst is present in more than 70 % of cases. Enlarged cysts can cause hepatomegaly, with or without right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. The most common symptoms of pulmonary CE are cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Approximately 60 % of pulmonary hydatid disease affects the right lung, and 50–60 % of cases involve the lower lobes [9]. Multiple cysts are common. Approximately 20 % of patients with lung cysts also have liver cysts [10].

Albendazole is the primary antiparasitic agent for the treatment of E. granulosus [24]. Albendazole inhibits microtubule assembly, leading to impaired glucose absorption and causing glycogen depletion, followed by degeneration of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of the germinal layer, resulting in cell death [9]. Albendazole is poorly absorbed and should be ingested with food, ideally a fatty meal, to increase bioavailability (15 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses to a maximum of 800 mg). Oral absorption in humans is approximately 1–5 % at the therapeutic dose, and the half-life is 8–12 h. Albendazole undergoes rapid first-pass metabolism, primarily via CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 as well as flavin enzymes, generating two metabolites (sulfoxide and sulfone). Albendazole sulfoxide is the active metabolite responsible for the therapeutic effects [11], [12]. Peak concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide are detected in serum 2–5 h after a therapeutic dose, with a reported half-life of 12–18 h [13].

Albendazole is generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of gastrointestinal discomfort. It is rarely associated with more severe adverse effects such as leukopenia (0.044 %), anemia (0.004 %), and raised liver enzymes (0.035 %) [14]. Pancytopenia is a rare effect that occurs more commonly in patients with preexisting liver disease [15]. Death is occasionally reported after therapeutic albendazole use due to pancytopenia and subsequent septic shock [5].

Praziquantel exhibits protoscolicidal activity. However, its efficacy in clinical studies is variable, and, thus far, it does not have a definitive role in primary drug therapy [16], [17], [18], [19]. Limited case studies suggest that the combination of albendazole and praziquantel may be superior to albendazole alone, but further research is needed [20].

The most commonly reported adverse effects of praziquantel involved the neuromuscular system, digestive system, cardiovascular system, and anaphylaxis, with incidence rates of 3.80 %, 2.44 %, 0.542 %, and 0.542 %, respectively [21], [22], [23]. According to Olds et al. [21], the adverse effects of praziquantel were mainly nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and bloody diarrhea. In 2020, one case of neurocysticercosis caused by acute pancytopenia that resulted from a high dose of praziquantel was reported in China [6]. In that case, no adverse effects were observed with a 10-day course of albendazole (20 mg/kg qd) or praziquantel (20 mg/kg qd) in 2011. However, the patient was prescribed an increased dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg qd for 5 days) twice in June and December 2018. As a result, acute pancytopenia occurred repeatedly. Each time, the cell count gradually recovered 2 weeks after praziquantel withdrawal. Thus, the praziquantel-related adverse effects were caused by the high dose of the drug. In the present study, the patient weighed 68 kg and was prescribed praziquantel 600 mg once a day (8–9 mg/kg), which was much lower than the high dose of praziquantel reported above (40 mg/kg).

Our patient was prescribed albendazole 400 mg twice a day on the fourth day of admission and praziquantel 600 mg once a day on the 12th day of admission. Although the patient took enoxaparin and torsemide at the same time, these two drugs were taken by the patient before and no adverse reaction occured.The patient suffered diarrhea, stomachache, increased bilirubin, hair loss and acute fatal pancytopenia after 10 days of albendazole and praziquantel administration. After 21 days of treatment, the patient exhibited neutropenia and stopped taking albendazole and praziquantel. The patient’s white blood cells, neutrophils, and platelets further decreased in the first few days after albendazole and praziquantel withdrawal, suggesting that the drug was not cleared completely from his body or the hematopoietic function of bone marrow did not return to normal. Eight days after discontinuation, the patient’s blood cells began to return to normal levels.

Opatrny [5] reported the case of a patient who died with severe prolonged pancytopenia that began during the third week of therapy for a pulmonary echinococcal cyst. In 2014, two cases of bilineage cytopenia were reported separately [2], [3], both following a month of albendazole treatment for hydatid cyst disease. The case reported by Fredj [2] developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and another reported by Aç ıkgöz [3] developed thrombocytopenia and anemia. Our patient developed pancytopenia after 10 days of albendazole and praziquantel treatment. This effect may be exacerbated in patients with pre-existing liver failure. Our patient was admitted with increased bilirubin and prescribed albendazole for more than 10 days, which may prolong the clearance time of albendazole and praziquantel in the body. Thus, we speculated that the severe adverse reaction was caused by the accumulation of albendazole and praziquantel because of the liver dysfunction of the patient. Table 1 shows the summary of the clinical features of the patients with pancytopenia induced by albendazole or praziquantel.Table 1 Summary of the clinical features of the patients with pancytopenia induced by albendazole and praziquantel.

Pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis are not mentioned on the label of albendazole and praziquantel in China. Clinicians lack experience in the diagnosis and treatment of echinococcosis. We analyzed the time and occurrence of adverse reactions to albendazole and praziquantel. Clinicians should pay attention to monitoring the reaction during treatment period.

Conclusion

We suggest that patients who take albendazole and praziquantel, especially those who have been treated for more than 10 days and have liver dysfunction should closely monitor the treatment reaction such as gastrointestinal tract reaction, hair loss or complete blood count. Once severe adverse reaction occurs, the drug should be immediately stopped. Supportive treatments such as the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) against neutropenia or antibiotics to prevent infection should be considered.
