pmc1 Introduction

Emphysematous cystitis is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the presence of gas within the bladder wall and lumen, typically caused by a bacterial infection. It primarily affects individuals with predisposing factors such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and urinary tract abnormalities.1 This article provides an overview of the clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies for emphysematous cystitis, exemplified by a case involving a 74-year-old male patient with a complex medical history. The patient presented with lower abdominal pain, signs of infection, and urinary symptoms. Computed tomography revealed bladder wall thickening with the presence of air bubbles. Prompt recognition, appropriate diagnostic investigations, and aggressive management were crucial in improving the patient's overall condition.

2 Case presentation

A 74-year-old male patient presented at the emergency department with a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain and signs of infection, accompanied by a deterioration in his overall well-being. His medical history included uncontrolled diabetes mellitus treated with metformin, a right femur fracture 20 years ago, a sequela of stroke resulting in motor aphasia and facial paralysis, urethral stenosis, and recurrent urinary tract infections, with the most recent episode occurring 2 months prior and was treated with intravenous antibiotics. The patient reported dysuria, fever, and pneumaturia.

The patient exhibited lower abdominal tenderness upon physical examination, while other findings were unremarkable. Blood laboratory tests revealed hyperglycemia (3.18 g/L) and elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (143 mg/L). Lactate levels were measured at 4.07 mmol/L. Renal and hepatic functions were within the normal range. The urine dipstick test showed positive results for leukocytes and nitrites.

Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse thickening of the bladder wall with multiple circumferentially arranged air bubbles within it. Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Urinary analysis demonstrated the presence of numerous white blood cells (3500/mm³) and red blood cells (28000/mm³).Fig. 1 CT scan showing intraparenchymal air bubbles in the bladder wall (arrow) and intraluminal gas in the bladder (asterisk).

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. The patient was initiated on broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, including ceftriaxone (2 g, once daily), metronidazole (500 mg, three times daily), and gentamicin (80 mg, twice daily). A urinary catheter was inserted, resulting in the drainage of 500 ml of cloudy urine containing a significant amount of gas. Subsequent urine culture showed positive bacteriological growth with a polymorphic flora.

Due to the severity of the condition, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close clinical and biochemical monitoring for 5 days. A vigilant surveillance strategy was implemented to detect potential complications of bladder emphysema, such as bladder necrosis, abscess formation, or bladder perforation.

Following a 14-day course of intravenous antibiotics and insulin therapy, a notable improvement in the patient's overall condition was observed. Consequently, the patient was discharged from the hospital after a total of 20 days.

3 Discussion

Emphysematous cystitis is a rare and potentially life-threatening infection of the urinary bladder characterized by the presence of gas within the bladder wall and lumen. It accounts for approximately 1–2% of all cases of urinary tract infections, making it a relatively uncommon condition. The disease primarily affects individuals with certain predisposing factors, with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus being the most common risk factor, present in approximately 70–90% of cases. Other risk factors include urinary tract obstruction, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, and immunosuppression.1

The progression of emphysematous cystitis occurs in two distinct stages. In the initial stage, bacterial colonization takes place, leading to mild symptoms that are similar to uncomplicated cystitis. During this phase, bacteria, often gas-forming organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, proliferate within the bladder, resulting in the production of gas. Approximately 30–50% of patients remain in this stage without progressing further.2

However, in the second stage of the disease, more pronounced symptoms and complications can arise. Pneumaturia, the passage of gas in the urine, becomes evident. This advanced stage occurs in about 50–70% of cases and is associated with a higher risk of complications. The exact mechanisms underlying the occurrence of gas in emphysematous cystitis remain unclear. While the prevailing theory suggests that the high glucose concentration in bladder tissues promotes acid fermentation by Enterobacteriaceae, resulting in the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas, cases involving individuals without glucose metabolism disorders suggest that other exceptional circumstances can trigger the fermentation of proteins as well.3

Without prompt and appropriate treatment during the second stage of the disease, emphysematous cystitis can progress locally, leading to bladder necrosis, abscess formation, or even bladder perforation. Systemic complications, such as sepsis, can occur in approximately 10–20% of cases, significantly increasing the risk of mortality. Therefore, early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes.4

Imaging techniques play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis. Computed tomography (CT) is considered the gold standard imaging modality due to its ability to provide detailed visualization of the bladder and surrounding structures. CT scans can reveal characteristic findings in approximately 80–90% of cases, such as bladder wall thickening and the presence of gas bubbles within the bladder. Other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound or plain film of the abdomen, may have a lower sensitivity and specificity for detecting emphysematous cystitis.2

Early diagnosis is essential as it allows for the initiation of appropriate treatment strategies. Prompt bladder decompression, performed in about 70–80% of cases, helps relieve bladder distension and aids in the resolution of symptoms. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gas-forming bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are administered in nearly all cases to effectively control the infection. Commonly used antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime), aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and metronidazole. The duration of antibiotic therapy typically ranges from 10 to 14 days, but may be longer in severe or complicated cases.4

The overall prognosis of emphysematous cystitis depends on various factors, including the promptness of diagnosis, the severity of infection, the presence of underlying comorbidities, and the development of complications. Mortality rates range from 7 to 20%, with higher rates seen in patients with advanced age, severe sepsis, or delayed diagnosis.5

4 Conclusion

In conclusion, emphysematous cystitis is a complex and potentially life-threatening condition that primarily affects individuals with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Early recognition, diagnosis, and appropriate interventions, including bladder decompression, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and management of underlying risk factors, are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. Continued research is necessary to refine diagnostic approaches, optimize treatment strategies, and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this challenging condition.
