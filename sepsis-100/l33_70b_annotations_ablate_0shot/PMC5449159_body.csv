event,time
diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma ,-9720
treated by resection and radiotherapy ,-9720
developed a stenosis of the esophagus ,-8760
repeated aspiration led to several episodes of respiratory insufficiency due to pneumonia and purulent pleurisy ,-8760
treated by pleurectomy ,-8760
developed a restrictive ventilation pattern and a recurrent nerve palsy ,-8760
treated by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostoma ,-8760
put on home ventilation ,-8760
mobility decreased ,-8760
developed secondary depression ,-8760
stopped talking ,-8760
mandible was nearly fixed ,-8760
could not open her mouth over a maximum of 20 degrees ,-8760
left axis vertebralis was stented ,-4380
developed stenosis of the internal axis carotis on both sides ,-4380
diagnosed with arterial hypertension and secondary lactase deficiency ,-4380
esophageal stenosis was dilated ,-120
referred to the University of Erlangen due to a decreasing general condition ,0
fistula between the esophagus and tracheal membrane had occurred ,0
examined by several chiefs and consultants ,0
deemed too unstable for open surgery ,0
inability to open the mouth and the recurrent nerve palsy ,0
referred to our hospital on the surgical intensive care unit ,15
suffering from pneumonia by 4-multiresistente gramnegative Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the right lung ,15
put on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) ,15
thoracic computed tomography confirmed a big fistula of the tracheal membrane ,16
decision to try endobronchial stenting was made ,16
procedure was performed ,17
vv-ECMO began to be partly ineffective due to rising septical issues ,17
high volume input of physiological saline was needed ,17
oral approach would only allow a small flexible bronchoscope ,17
approach for the upper part of the trachea had to be performed through the percutaneous tracheostoma in a retrograde manner ,17
trying different Dumon and one-hybrid self expandable metalic y-stent ,17
plan was to changeover to a more floppy Freitag stent (FS) ,17
successful retrograde stenting was performed in four steps ,17
Step I: manually compressed “y” of the FS was successfully pushed downward on the main carina ,17
Step II: frontal surface of the stent was cut with at least 1 cm opening in the longitudinal axis ,17
Step III: jagwire was introduced through the mouth into the trachea ,17
Step IV: regular tracheal cannula was introduced for ventilation ,17
lungs were not aerated at that point of time ,17
spontaneous breathing work increased and the vv-ECMO support was reduced ,120
lungs became re-aerated again ,120
patient woke up again and could communicate with her family by writing and her eyes ,120
infections continued to be very severe ,120
spontaneous work of breathing never exceeded a tidal ventilation of 170 mL per breath ,120
reduction of intravenous saline injection was limited ,120
patient along with her family decided actively to reduce the vv-ECMO support ,360
patient died on 18 November 2016 due to pulmonary infection ,420
