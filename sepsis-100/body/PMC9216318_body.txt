pmcIntroduction

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening clinical syndrome secondary to a serious bacterial infection leading to rapidly progressive involvement of multiple skin layers and culminating in fulminant tissue destruction (Puvanendran, Huey, and Pasupathy 2009). Presentations often vary and may resemble cellulitis initially, the sequelae of which are dependent upon the anatomical involvement, organisms identified, the necessity of debridement, degree of necrotizing soft tissue infection, and extent of surgical debridement warranted. NF is classified into four main types with different pathogens exhibiting anatomical predilection according to the NF subtype involved. The most affected sites are the limbs, trunk, and perineum. Fournier's gangrene is a polymicrobial NF of the perineal and the perianal areas and case series have shown a mortality rate of 20% to 40% with an incidence as high as 88% in some reports (Benjelloun el et al. 2013; Misiakos et al. 2014).

Type I, comprising mainly a polymicrobial infection (Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus, Vibrio, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides Fragilis), is commonly seen in elderly or diabetic patients. Type II, also referred to as flesh-eating disease, affects all healthy age groups and can include (Haemolytic Group A Streptococcus, Staphylococci including MRSA). Type III, which is caused by Clostridium Perfringes, is seen post injuries or surgeries, and clinically can only present with crepitus initially. It is commonly seen in intravenous drug users injecting heroin subcutaneously. Lastly, Type IV is due to marine organisms or fungal infections. Additional risk factors for NF are skin/mucosal breach, immunosuppression, major penetrating trauma, recent surgery, obesity, alcoholism, and malignancy (Khamnuan et al. 2015).

The systemic involvement of sepsis, single or multi-organ failure along with the locally spreading erythema, pain area disproportionate to clinical exam, crepitus, skin bullae, necrosis, and or ecchymosis are the main clinical manifestations of NF. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) is a scoring system that aids to risk-stratify patients presenting with signs of cellulitis for likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis based on six parameters (see supplementary Table 1). A score of ≤5 = <50% risk (low); 6–7 = risk (intermediate); ≥8 = >75% risk (high) (Wong et al. 2004). Radiological imaging including X-ray of the affected area, CT scan, and MRI can identify areas of fluid collection, inflammation, and gas loculations within affected soft tissues.

Group B infections have started to become more prominent compared to Group A Streptococcal infections, as noted in case studies and series. We describe a case of Group B Streptococcus Pneumonia Necrotising Fasciitis (GBSPn NF) with refractory Streptococcal Toxic Shock Like Syndrome (TSLS) within the ICU and revisit the literature surrounding the emergence of GBSPn NF.

Case description

Mr X, a 67-year-old male, presented to our Emergency Department at a university teaching Regional Hospital via ambulance with worsening left leg swelling from a recent cactus plant injury. A week prior to presentation he had sustained a minor penetrating injury to his left lower leg from a cactus plant. He reported progressive left leg swelling, worsening of erythema along with pain for 2 days and felt generally unwell, requiring paramedic assistance.

He had a background history of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and mild Ulcerative Colitis. He was not on any immunosuppressants. He had long-standing deranged liver function tests and was being followed up by a gastroenterologist. Table 1 reflects a complete case description.Table 1 Clinical and Biochemical Summary of Events.

Discussion

GBSPn remains an extremely uncommon pathogenic agent of NF. Whilst the precipitating event was a cactus spine injury, the resultant inflammation often leads to granulomas and if infections do occur, they are associated with Mycobacterium Marinum, Staphylococcus Aureus, Clostridium Tetani, Enterobacter, and Nocardia infections as causative organisms as noted by Deiter et al and Snyder et al (Dieter, Whitehouse, and Gulliver 2017; Snyder and Schwartz 1983). Despite a background of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Cactus spine prick, no association could be found in the literature with development of GBSPn NF by these conditions. The case had risk factors associated with increased mortality in NF as noted by P. Khamnuan et al (Khamnuan et al. 2015).

We conducted a cohort review from PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL of the literature describing NF caused by GBSPn which yielded 5 case reports published between 2011 and 2020 (see supplementary Table 2). Serotyping was reported in only 3 cases, 9V, 23F and 9N, Park et al, Zhang et al and Hovmand et al respectively. Hovmand et al had reported 14 cases between the year 2001 and 2016 (Hovmand et al. 2019). This again supports the notion that GBSPn NF remains a rare finding underpinning the importance of this uncommon causative organism that leads to fatal NF.

Despite imploring source control, anti-inflammatory measures, an Oxiris filter, IVIG, and Lincomycin, our patient still succumbed to GBSPn induced TSLS. GBSPn from tissue showed intermediate minimum inhibitory concentration to penicillin. The LRINEC initially ascribed a low risk for NF in stark contrast to the clinical presentation. This is in keeping with literature that states that there is poor sensitivity and external validity issues and one should rely more on clinical suspicion (Bechar et al. 2017; Young et al. 2006; Broman et al. 2019). Whilst imaging can be useful in atypical presentations, it should not delay treatment, as this can lead to high mortality rates, quoted as high as 60% in the literature (El-Qushayri et al. 2020).

Conclusion

GBSPn NF with TSLS remains a condition associated with high mortality, and reliance on scoring systems could have a deleterious outcome on patients. Clinical suspicion and empirical antibiotic coverage according to local therapeutic guidelines is an essential key element, while early debridement and critical care support remain the mainstay of therapy.
