"18 years is not mentioned in the case report, so we omit it. The patient is a man, so we keep it. The patient was admitted to the hospital, so we keep it. The patient had high-grade fever, so we separate it into two events: fever and high-grade fever. The patient's wife and two daughters had been diagnosed with influenza B virus infection several days prior, so we separate it into three events: wife diagnosed with influenza B virus infection, daughter 1 diagnosed with influenza B virus infection, daughter 2 diagnosed with influenza B virus infection. The patient was diagnosed with an influenza B virus infection, so we keep it. The patient was administered oseltamivir, so we keep it. The patient returned to the clinic because of persistent fever and dyspnea at rest, so we separate it into two events: fever persisted, dyspnea at rest. The patient was admitted to our hospital, so we keep it. The patient's temperature was 38.7°C, blood pressure was 117/80 mmHg, heart rate was 76 beats/min, and oxygen saturation level was 88% on room air, so we separate it into four events: temperature 38.7°C, blood pressure 117/80 mmHg, heart rate 76 beats/min, oxygen saturation level 88% on room air. Fine crackles were audible in lung fields on both sides, so we keep it. The patient's white blood cell count was 7400/mm3, C-reactive protein was 18.1 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase was 91 IU/L, L-lactate dehydrogenase was 362 IU/L, creatine kinase was 793 IU/L, and Krebs von den Lungen-6 was 1772 U/mL, so we separate it into six events: white blood cell count 7400/mm3, C-reactive protein 18.1 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 91 IU/L, L-lactate dehydrogenase 362 IU/L, creatine kinase 793 IU/L, Krebs von den Lungen-6 1772 U/mL. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated hypoxemia, so we keep it. Chest radiography showed ground-glass opacity in lung fields on both sides, so we keep it. Chest computed tomography showed diffuse ground-glass opacity in lung fields on both sides, so we keep it. Gram staining, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, periodic acid-Schiff stain of sputum samples and sputum culture did not show any evidence of bacterial or fungal infection, so we keep it. There was no evidence of bacterial infection in blood cultures, so we keep it. The patient received high-flow nasal oxygen support, so we keep it. The patient was treated with intravenous peramivir and antibiotics, so we separate it into two events: peramivir, antibiotics. The reticular shadow on chest CT worsened, so we keep it. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio deteriorated to 83 on day 3, so we keep it. The patient was diagnosed with severe ARDS associated with influenza B virus infection, so we keep it. The patient and the family refused to do intubation, so we keep it. The patient continued high-flow nasal oxygen support, so we keep it. Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column hemoperfusion was performed on day 3, so we keep it. The patient was administered intravenous methylprednisolone, so we keep it. The patient's respiratory status did not improve, so we keep it. The reticular infiltrates on chest CT worsened, so we keep it. The patient received noninvasive positive pressure ventilation support, so we keep it. The patient was administered immunosuppressant therapy, so we keep it. The patient died on day 129 after admission, so we keep it. An autopsy was performed, so we keep it. Pathological findings of lung specimens showed diffuse alveolar damage with prominent hyaline membranes, so we keep it. ",
