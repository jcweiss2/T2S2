I have a case report here about a patient with a severe infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. I need to determine if this patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's see what the case says.

First, the patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted with a chief complaint of recurrent fever for more than a month, nausea, and vomiting for a week. Physical examination didn't reveal any obvious clinical signs, but her blood tests showed some abnormalities: high neutrophil count, high monocyte count, low lymphocyte percentage, low red blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, low average red blood cell hemoglobin concentration, high platelet count, low platelet distribution width, and high C-reactive protein (CRP).

So, she had some signs of infection and inflammation based on her blood tests. They did a bone marrow puncture that showed megakaryocyte maturation disorder, and blood culture indicated Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. She was admitted to the hematology department with diagnoses including secondary infectious thrombocytopenia, gram-negative bacilli septicemia (Klebsiella pneumoniae), liver abscess, bilateral lung inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.

They treated her with vancomycin, caspofungin, dexamethasone, and posaconazole oral suspension. They also did liver abscess puncture and drainage. Her inflammatory indexes improved, but then she developed issues with her left eye, including loss of light perception, eyelid redness and pain, purulent secretion, and left-sided headache. Ophthalmology diagnosed endogenous endophthalmitis, orbital cellulitis, rubeosis iridis, exudative retinal detachment, and diabetic retinopathy.

They did intravitreal injections with vancomycin and ceftazidime three times, and after left eyeball enucleation, she had another fever episode. Post-operation, she was given moxifloxacin and sulperazon for anti-infection, but her temperature elevated again. CT showed inflammation in both lungs, pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural thickening and effusion, and atelectasis in the right lower lobe. She had a history of hypertension, controlled with medication, and no other significant past medical history.

Her diagnoses included sepsis, secondary thrombocytopenia, liver abscess, gram-negative bacilli sepsis (Klebsiella pneumoniae), infection of lumbar vertebrae, mesenteric panniculitis, pelvic effusion, pericardial effusion, suppurative endophthalmitis, orbital cellulitis, retinal detachment, type 2 diabetes with nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, hepatic and renal cysts, hypoproteinemia, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, lacunar cerebral infarction, moderate anemia, and risk of malnutrition.

On April 20th, she had a convulsion with unconsciousness and was transferred to the respiratory intensive care unit. Emergency CT showed lacunar infarction and encephalomalacia, and more advanced bilateral pleural effusion and right lower lobe insufficient inflation. She was in a coma, unresponsive, with neck stiffness, weak eye light response, uncooperative limb muscle strength examination, low muscle tone, suspicious left Babinski sign positive, and right Babinski sign negative. The impression was intracranial infection.

They performed a lumbar puncture, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemistry showed low glucose, low chloride, and extremely high protein. Microbial metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the CSF showed a high sequence of Klebsiella pneumoniae with a drug-resistant gene, blaSHV, which is an SHV-type beta-lactamase associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production.

They started treatment with meropenem 2 grams every 8 hours, prolonged infusion for 3 hours, to treat the intracranial infection. Her body temperature, blood tests, and CRP improved over time. CT on May 18th showed improvement in pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. CSF analysis on May 23rd still showed elevated proteins and other abnormalities, but overall, she improved and was discharged on May 31st with follow-up planned.

Now, according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It's identified by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of ≥2 points secondary to the infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality.

But in clinical practice, sepsis is often operationalized using the quick SOFA (qSOFA) criteria, which are:

- Altered mental status

- Systolic blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg

- Respiratory rate ≥22 breaths per minute

If a patient has at least two of these, it's suggestive of sepsis, and they should be further evaluated for organ dysfunction.

However, in this case report, some of the vital signs and specific lab values needed to calculate the SOFA score aren't provided directly. But let's see what information is available.

First, the patient had a suspected infection, as evidenced by the recurrent fever, positive blood culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multiple foci of infection (liver abscess, lung inflammation, endophthalmitis, intracranial infection). So, the presence of infection is clear.

Now, regarding the criteria for sepsis:

1. **Altered mental status**: The patient had a convulsion with unconsciousness, was in a coma, unresponsive, with neck stiffness, and suspicious positive Babinski sign. This definitely indicates altered mental status.

2. **Systolic blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg**: The case mentions she had hypertension, but her blood pressure control was with medication, and the highest recorded was 180/100 mm Hg. However, during her illness, especially in the ICU, her blood pressure might have dropped. But具体血压值没有提供。如果她的血压降到100 mm Hg或以下，那就符合这个标准。

3. **Respiratory rate ≥22 breaths per minute**: The respiratory rate isn't specified in the case report, so we can't assess this criterion.

Given that she had at least one criterion (altered mental status), and likely others depending on her blood pressure, which might have been low during her critical illness, it's reasonable to conclude that she met the criteria for sepsis.

Moreover, considering the severity of her illness—sepsis with multiorgan involvement, including lung, liver, eye, and central nervous system, along with findings like high CRP, abnormal blood counts, and eventually, intracranial infection with positive CSF culture for Klebsiella pneumoniae—it's clear that she had a severe form of sepsis.

Additionally, the term "septicemia" is used in her diagnosis, which is synonymous with sepsis, further supporting this classification.

As for septic shock, which is a subset of sepsis with circulatory failure, the case doesn't provide specific hemodynamic data, such as blood pressure or lactate levels, which are required to diagnose septic shock.

However, given her profound illness, including coma and multiple organ dysfunctions, it's possible that she may have met the criteria for septic shock at some point, but without specific hemodynamic data, we can't confirm that definitively.

Therefore, based on the available information, it's appropriate to say that she had sepsis, likely progressing to a severe form, possibly including septic shock, but the data provided doesn't allow for definitive classification of septic shock.

But for the purpose of this exercise, where I need to reply with 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, and considering that she clearly had sepsis, I will answer 1.

pmcIntroduction

Klebsiella pneumoniae, belonging to the gram-negative aerobic bacteria, is commonly found in communities and healthcare sites. Klebsiella pneumoniae is often parasitic in the human respiratory tract, intestinal tract, and biliary tract (1). It is an important conditional pathogen related to several infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, pyogenic liver abscess, and urinary tract infections. In some severe conditions, immunocompromised patients may even experience life-threatening diseases such as sepsis and purulent meningitis (2). Klebsiella pneumoniae represents an infrequent cause of meningitis in South-East Asia and North-East Asia, frequently associated with septic metastatic complications. And the in-hospital mortality rate of patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis is 8.0%, which increases substantially for those older than 45 years (3).

Along with the development of bacterial virulence and the changes in capsular polysaccharides, a new variant of Klebsiella pneumoniae has occurred, namely hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP). The hvKP has unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, for instance, high mucus phenotype, special serotype, and carrying special virulence genes (4). It can lead to a higher infectious rate in patients with low immune function, which also manifests with more severe clinical symptoms. It is traditionally considered that there is no overlap of the hvKP genome between high virulence and multi-drug resistance; most hvKPs are sensitive to commonly used antibiotics (5). Therefore, patients with hvKP infection require timely administration of antibiotics.

The most important mechanism of drug resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae is to produce the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (6). The ESBLs are β-lactamases that can hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and monocyclic amides, it was reported that the detection rate of ESBLs-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was 27.4% in 2015 (7). With the wide application of new antibiotics such as carbapenems, the drug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae has increased, and carbapenem-resistant and fully drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae have emerged (8). A study has identified that some phenotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae can produce 1 or more β-lactamases; their plasmids often carry aminoglycosides, quinolones, and other antimicrobial resistance genes at the same time (9). Till now, the diagnosis and treatment of intracranial infection caused by an ESBLs-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are remains difficult, corresponding guidelines on empiric treatment should be considered in the management of bacterial meningitis.

Here, we report a case of adult intracranial infection caused by ESBL-producing hvKP in a 65-year-old female, this case highlights to us that the effective and proper identification of these ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia is a key step in the rational prevention and treatment for infectious patients. We present the following article in accordance with the CARE reporting checklist (available at https://atm.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/atm-22-3805/rc).

Case presentation

A 65-year-old female who had a chief complaint of recurrent fever for more than 1 month, nausea, and vomiting for 1 week was admitted to our hospital. She had no obvious induction of fever, and her highest body temperature was 38 ℃. No obvious clinical signs were found by physical examination. Routine blood test results showed the following: neutrophil count 6.96×109/L ↑, monocyte count 0.86×109/L ↑, lymphocyte percentage 14.9% ↓, red blood cell count 3.17×1012/L ↓, hemoglobin content 87 g/L ↓, hematocrit 0.28 L/L ↓, average red blood cell hemoglobin concentration 312 g/L ↓, platelet count 363×109/L ↑, platelet distribution width 8.3 fl ↓, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 52.01 mg/L ↑. Her blood routine test showed a gradually decreased platelet count, with abnormal infection indicators. Bone puncture showed megakaryocyte maturation disorder, and blood culture indicated Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis.

She was then admitted to the hematology department and diagnosed with “secondary infectious thrombocytopenia, gram-negative bacilli septicemia (Klebsiella pneumoniae), liver abscess, bilateral lung inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension grade 3 (extremely high risk)”. She was given vancomycin, caspofungin, dexamethasone, and posaconazole oral suspension for therapy. Liver abscess puncture and drainage treatment were performed with the assistance of the interventional oncology department. The inflammatory indexes tested by laboratory tests decreased significantly after treatment. During this period, light perception disappeared in the left eye
