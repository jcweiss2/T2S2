I have a case here that I need to evaluate for sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's see what we've got.

First, the patient is a 76-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department for severe hyponatremia discovered during preoperative checks for port placement related to chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. So, he has advanced cancer, which is important to note because cancer patients are at higher risk for infections and sepsis.

His medical history includes diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. On presentation, he had jugular vein distention and lower extremity pitting edema, which could be due to heart failure or other causes.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done, showing a normal left ventricular cavity size with mildly reduced systolic function (estimated EF 45-50%), septal flattening suggesting RV pressure/volume overload, left atrial enlargement, and suspected mitral valve vegetation with severe mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation was also noted with an elevated RV systolic pressure of 53 mmHg, attributed to type 2 and type 3 pulmonary arterial hypertension, possibly due to left heart dysfunction and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.

Further TTE revealed ill-defined thickening in the tricuspid valve leaflets. The patient was afebrile but had leukocytosis and a history of recent urethral instrumentation for a urological procedure. Blood cultures were taken on day 1, and an infectious disease specialist was consulted for possible infective endocarditis, starting broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The next day, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, showing normal left ventricular size and function (EF 60-65%), normal RV size and function, hypermobile interatrial septum without PFO, and no left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus. Significant findings included large vegetations on both mitral and tricuspid valves with severe mitral regurgitation and systolic flow reversal in the pulmonary vein. There was also a large vegetation on the tricuspid valve with tricuspid regurgitation and RVSP of 47 mmHg.

Blood cultures remained negative, and PCR tests for Coxiella burnetii, Legionella spp., and Brucella spp. were negative. Workup for antiphospholipid syndrome was unremarkable. Given the vegetations on both mitral and tricuspid valves in the setting of negative blood cultures and metastatic pancreatic cancer, the suspected diagnosis was marantic (nonbacterial) endocarditis.

The patient was previously on apixaban, which was discontinued due to severe thrombocytopenia. It was recommended to start low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin once platelets recovered above 50,000/mm³. A head CT was done to rule out intracerebral hemorrhage related to confusion, and infectious disease recommended discontinuing broad-spectrum antibiotics with observation of clinical course to confirm the diagnosis of marantic endocarditis. The patient was started on enoxaparin once platelets recovered.

Now, according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It's identified by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is often operationalized using qSOFA (quick SOFA) in the emergency department setting: respiratory rate of 22 or more breaths per minute, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or less.

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to greatly increase mortality. It's defined as a subset of sepsis in which despite adequate fluid resuscitation, there's persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia or drugs known to cause lactate elevation.

Looking back at the case, the patient presented with severe hyponatremia, which could be due to various causes including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is common in malignancies. He had jugular vein distention and lower extremity pitting edema, which could be related to heart failure or other causes of fluid overload.

The TTE showed left atrial enlargement, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation with elevated RV systolic pressure, suggesting possible right heart strain. The TEE confirmed large vegetations on both mitral and tricuspid valves, which were initially thought to be due to infective endocarditis but turned out to be nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) given negative blood cultures and the presence of advanced malignancy.

Now, regarding sepsis or septic shock, let's see:

- Was there a suspected or confirmed infection? Initially, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infective endocarditis, but blood cultures were negative, and the final diagnosis was NBTE, which is a noninfectious condition. So, there was no confirmed infection.

- Were there any signs of organ dysfunction as per qSOFA? The patient was afebrile, which is good, but had leukocytosis, which could indicate an infection or other inflammatory process. However, since the final diagnosis was NBTE, which is noninfectious, the leukocytosis might be related to the underlying malignancy or other causes.

- Was there any evidence of hypotension or need for vasopressors? The case doesn't mention any specific blood pressure readings or the need for vasopressors, so it's unclear.

- Was there any altered mental status? The patient had a history of confusion, but it's not specified whether this was acute or chronic. The head CT was done to rule out intracerebral hemorrhage related to confusion, but the results aren't mentioned.

Given that the final diagnosis was NBTE, which is a noninfectious condition, and there was no confirmed infection (negative blood cultures), it seems that sepsis or septic shock is unlikely in this case. The patient's symptoms and findings were more related to his underlying malignancy, heart failure, and possibly other comorbidities.

However, it's important to note that in critically ill patients, especially those with malignancies, distinguishing between infectious and noninfectious causes can be challenging, and sometimes empirical antibiotic therapy is started until the cause is clarified.

In summary, based on the available information, it doesn't appear that the patient met the criteria for sepsis or septic shock as defined by Sepsis-3, given the absence of confirmed infection and lack of specific signs of organ dysfunction related to infection.

pmcIntroduction

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare condition in which platelet thrombi form on heart valves, typically in patients with advanced malignancy.1 This form of noninfectious endocarditis, also known as marantic endocarditis, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, or verrucous endocarditis, can affect undamaged valves but can also occur in patients with valvular pathology. It is different from culture-negative endocarditis, which is caused by infectious agents that cannot be easily identified. The most common cause of NBTE is advanced malignancy (occurring in 80% of cases), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus. Other possible causes include antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and burns.2 A conclusive diagnosis of NBTE can be achieved through pathological examination of thrombi present in autopsy or surgical specimens. However, as obtaining valvular tissue for analysis may not be a practical method, clinicians typically rely on a combination of clinical and echocardiographic evidence and an absence of microbiological evidence to arrive at a diagnosis. The identification of valvular vegetations via echocardiography in patients who are at an elevated risk for NBTE, in the absence of systemic infection, serves as a salient indication in support of a diagnosis of NBTE. Involvement of both the tricuspid valve (TV) and mitral valve (MV) in a patient with advanced malignancy is rare and has not been described in any of the available literature.

Case Presentation

The patient is a 76-year-old man who presented to the emergency department for severe hyponatremia found during routine preoperative evaluation. The patient’s medical history includes pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the liver, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. The patient was initially scheduled to undergo port placement for chemotherapy, but during routine laboratory workup they were found to have a sodium level of 116 mmol/L and were subsequently sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. During evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was found to have x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics while receiving small boluses of fluid for hyponatremia. The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit for continued management of severe hyponatremia. On physical examination the patient was found to have jugular vein distention alongside lower extremity pitting edema. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered to assess cardiac function and demonstrated a normal left ventricular cavity size with mildly reduced systolic function (visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%-50%). There was septal flattening (right ventricular [RV] pressure/volume overload), left atrial enlargement (Figure 1A, Video 1), and suspected MV vegetation (Figure 2, Video 2) with severe mitral regurgitation (MV E wave = 1.3 m/sec; Figures 1B, and 3, Videos 3 and 4). Tricuspid regurgitation Doppler confirmed an elevated RV systolic pressure (RVSP = 53 mm Hg) using an inferior vena cava-estimated right atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg. The elevated right heart pressure was attributed to type 2 and type 3 pulmonary arterial hypertension, assuming a combination of underlying left heart dysfunction and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. Further evaluation of the TTE showed ill-defined thickening in the TV leaflets (Figure 1A, Video 1). The patient was afebrile but had leukocytosis with a history of recent urethral instrumentation for a urological procedure. Blood cultures were obtained on day 1. An infectious disease specialist was consulted for evaluation of possible infective endocarditis, and the patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics.Figure 1 (A) Two-dimensional TTE, apical 4-chamber view without (A) and with (B) color flow Doppler, midsystolic phase, demonstrates left atrial enlargement (left atrial volume index, 59 mL/m2), a mass on the TV (arrow), and severe eccentric mitral regurgitation (MV E max 1.3 m/sec).

The patient was subsequently scheduled for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) the following day. Results of the TEE showed normal left ventricular size and function, ejection fraction of 60%-65%, normal RV size and function (Figure 4A, Videos 5, and 6), hypermobile interatrial septum without patent foramen ovale and with no left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus (Figure 5, Video 6). Significant findings included 2 large vegetations on the atrial aspect of MV leaflets, anterior leaflet measuring 1.3 × 1.1 cm, and posterior leaflet measuring 1.2 × 0.9 cm alongside severe mitral regurgitation with systolic flow reversal in the pulmonary vein (Figures 4A–C, and 5, Videos 5, 6, and 7). Imaging of the TV showed a large 1.6 × 1.1 cm vegetation on the TV leaflet with tricuspid regurgitation and RVSP 47 mm Hg (Figures 6, and 7, Videos 8, and 9).Figure 4 Two-dimensional TEE, 4-chamber view (0°) during early systole, without (A) and with (B) color flow Doppler, demonstrates vegetations on the
