I have a case report here about a patient who developed Mendelson's syndrome after a stroke, and I need to determine if this patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's see what the case is about.

So, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension. She presented with acute dyspnea, fecal incontinence, left hemiplegia, dextroversion, dysarthria, and vomiting. She was found to have right thalamus and putamen bleeding on a head CT and was treated conservatively.

Her initial vital signs were: systolic blood pressure of 91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24/min, and SpO2 of 86% on 4 L/min oxygen. Her oral hygiene was poor, which is noted.

Her condition deteriorated rapidly in the emergency room, and she required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation due to low SpO2 levels.

Blood tests showed a low white blood cell count of 1900/μL, mildly elevated CRP of 3.6 mg/dL, and respiratory failure with PaO2 of 64 mmHg on 4 L/min oxygen. Hepatorenal function was normal.

Chest X-ray showed extensive infiltration shadows in the left lung and right lower lung field. Chest CT showed consolidations with ground-glass opacities in the right middle lobe and left upper and lower lobes.

She was diagnosed with Mendelson's syndrome, which is chemical pneumonitis due to aspiration of gastric contents, likely from the initial vomiting episode.

Sputum culture showed Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella oxytoca, both at high concentrations, suggesting bacterial aspiration pneumonia on top of the chemical pneumonitis.

Treatment included mechanical ventilation with specific settings, antibiotics (meropenem and levofloxacin), and corticosteroids (prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day).

The patient improved, with resolution of infiltration shadows and improvement in P/F ratio, allowing for extubation on day 12 and transfer to neurosurgery on day 22, followed by a rehabilitation hospital.

Now, to determine if this patient has sepsis or septic shock based on Sepsis-3 criteria, I need to recall what those criteria are.

Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection." It introduced the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to quantify organ dysfunction.

However, in clinical practice, sepsis is often identified by the presence of infection along with organ dysfunction, which can be assessed using the quick SOFA (qSOFA) criteria: respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute or more, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with particularly low blood pressure that doesn't respond to fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure, along with a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

In this case, the patient had a suspected infection—both chemical pneumonitis from aspiration of gastric contents and bacterial pneumonia from aspiration of oral bacteria, as suggested by the sputum culture.

Regarding organ dysfunction, the patient had respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, which indicates acute respiratory failure, a type of organ dysfunction.

Additionally, there was evidence of possible acute kidney injury with BUN of 27 mg/dL, but creatinine was 0.7 mg/dL, and eGFR was 64 ml/min/1.73 m², which is mildly decreased but may be within her baseline given her age.

Blood pressure was initially 91 mmHg systolic, which is somewhat low, but it's not specified if this required vasopressors.

The patient was treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids, suggesting that there was concern for both the chemical pneumonitis and bacterial pneumonia.

Given that the patient had a suspected infection (aspiration of gastric contents and possible bacterial aspiration pneumonia) along with organ dysfunction (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation), this would meet the criteria for sepsis according to Sepsis-3.

However, to diagnose septic shock, there needs to be evidence of hypotension that requires vasopressors despite fluid resuscitation, along with lactic acidosis.

In this case report, it's not explicitly mentioned whether the patient required vasopressors or had elevated lactate levels.

The initial systolic blood pressure was 91 mmHg, which is low, but without information on mean arterial pressure or the need for vasopressors, it's unclear if this meets the criteria for septic shock.

Therefore, based on the available information, it seems that the patient has sepsis due to the presence of infection and organ dysfunction, but it's not definitively septic shock without more information on blood pressure management and lactate levels.

However, since the instruction is to reply with 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, and considering that the patient has infection and organ dysfunction, I will go with 1.

1 Introduction

Mendelson's syndrome is originally named after an American obstetrician and gynecologist, Curtis Mendelson, who reported severe aspiration pneumonia after vaginal delivery under general anesthesia [1]. It currently refers to severe aspiration chemical pneumonitis caused by aspiration of gastric contents under any condition associated with consciousness disorders. Rather than a bacterial pneumonia caused by aspiration of indigenous bacteria in the oral cavity, it is an acute chemical pneumonitis caused by regurgitation of gastric contents and subsequent aspiration that develops rapidly. In addition, it causes severe pneumonia because of acute lung tissue damage caused by digestive enzymes and may be complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this setting, the treatment benefit of steroids and antibiotics remains debatable.

Pneumonia is also an occasional complication of stroke, with an incidence rate of 5–38% [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]; therefore, the possibility of bacterial pneumonia because of aspiration of oral bacteria should also be considered after a stroke. ARDS could be developed because of bacterial and aspiration pneumonia. This report outlines the case of a patient in whom successful extubation and treatment with steroids and antibiotics for Mendelson's syndrome triggered by right putamen bleeding, were performed. Considering the complex condition of Mendelson's syndrome, which was further complicated by bacterial aspiration pneumonia, and the invaluable option with steroids and antibiotics, this case report would provide meaningful insights for clinical practice.

2 Case presentation

An 80-year-old woman, who was a non-smoker and had a history of hypertension, presented to our facility with acute dyspnea. At 7.40 a.m. on a day of May 2020, she suddenly developed fecal incontinence, left hemiplegia, dextroversion, dysarthria, and vomiting. She was last seen by her family members at around 1.00 p.m. the day before. At 8.20 a.m., she was transported to the emergency department of our hospital. She had impaired consciousness, with a Japan coma scale score of Ⅱ-10, as she opened her eyes when her name was called in a loud voice and on shaking. Head computed tomography (CT) findings showed right thalamus and putamen bleeding, and she was treated conservatively. The Glasgow coma scale score was 12; the vital signs were as follows: systolic blood pressure, 91 mmHg; respiratory rate, 24/min; and oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO2), 86% (with supplemental oxygen administration of 4 L/min by a nasal cannula, during the initial examination in the emergency room). The oral hygiene of the patient was poor. Neurological findings were suggestive of an intracranial lesion. Physical findings were diminished breath sounds on the left side and coarse crackles in the right lung; however, a decrease in breath sounds was also apparent in the front of the chest.

Her respiratory condition deteriorated rapidly in the emergency room, and the SpO2 level could not be maintained at 90% even after administration of oxygen using an oxygen mask with a reservoir bag at 10 L/min. Endotracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Chest CT findings showed bilateral infiltration, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the management of severe pneumonia.

Blood test results showed a decreased leukocyte count (1900/μL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (3.6 mg/dL), and respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) of 64 mmHg with supplemental oxygen administration of 4 L/min. In contrast, the hepatorenal function was normal (Table 1). Chest radiography at admission showed extensive infiltration shadows, mainly in the left whole lung fields and in the right lower lung field (Fig. 1a). On admission, head CT showed a hematoma extending from the right basal ganglia and putamen to the thalamus (Fig. 2). A low absorption area that appeared as cerebral edema was also observed surrounding the hematoma, and conservative treatment was performed as indicated. Chest CT findings at admission revealed consolidations admixture with ground-glass opacities mainly in the middle lobe of the right lung and the upper and lower lobes of the left lung (Fig. 3). Regarding the severity of pneumonia, the A-DROP [7] score corresponded to patient age, increased blood urea nitrogen, decreased SpO2, and impaired consciousness; hence, the patient required admission to the ICU. Moreover, the antigen test for coronavirus disease 2019 was negative.Table 1 Results of blood tests at the time of admission.

The clinical course of the patient is presented in Fig. 4. The cause of pneumonia was thought to be chemical pneumonitis because of aspiration of gastric contents caused by the initial vomiting, and it was rapidly worsening. In addition to the evident episode of vomiting, resulting in a very rapid decline of her respiratory status and bilateral infiltration on her chest CT image, she was diagnosed with Mendelson's syndrome just after mechanical ventilation initiation. Sputum culture predominantly showed the presence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella oxytoca in a concentration of ≥ 107 colony-forming units/mL. As they were in sufficient numbers, they were considered as the bacteria that caused the infection [8]. In addition, because of poor oral hygiene, aspiration bacterial pneumonia was considered to be a potential complication. Following leukocytopenia (white blood count [WBC], 1900/μL) and the low serum CR
