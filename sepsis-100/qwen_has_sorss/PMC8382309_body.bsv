I have a case report here about a patient with a liver abscess, and I need to determine if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. The Sepsis-3 criteria require two things: a suspected or confirmed infection and some abnormalities in blood pressure, respiratory rate, or mental status.

First, I need to confirm if there's a suspected or confirmed infection. From the case report, it's clear that the patient has a liver abscess, which is a type of infection. So, that part is satisfied.

Next, I need to look for abnormalities in blood pressure, respiratory rate, or mental status.

Looking at the blood pressure, on admission, it was 118/73 mmHg, which is within the normal range. However, on day 2, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 93/59 mmHg, which is considered low, especially since the patient was experiencing symptoms of pre-shock.

The respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute on admission, which is higher than the normal range (usually 12-20 breaths per minute), suggesting tachypnea.

There's no direct mention of mental status changes, but the patient was experiencing symptoms like abdominal distension, bellyache, and extreme thirst, which could be related to the infection.

Given that there is a confirmed infection (liver abscess) and abnormalities in blood pressure and respiratory rate, it seems that the patient meets the criteria for sepsis.

Moreover, with the blood pressure dropping to 93/59 mmHg and the need for noradrenaline to maintain blood pressure, along with other signs like fever and elevated markers of infection (leukocyte count, PCT, CRP), it suggests that the patient may have progressed to septic shock.

However, according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, septic shock is defined as sepsis with persisting hypotension that requires administration of vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg and has a serum lactate level >2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

In this case, the patient required noradrenaline to maintain blood pressure, indicating hypotension that wasn't responsive to fluids alone. However, the case report doesn't provide information about serum lactate levels or the adequacy of fluid resuscitation.

Given the information available, it seems that the patient likely meets the criteria for septic shock, but without specific lactate levels and details on fluid resuscitation, I can't be entirely sure.

Therefore, based on the available data, I would say that the patient has septic shock.

**Final Answer**

You are an expert physician.  Determine if the patient described in the following case report has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities.

Introduction

Eggerthella lenta (E. lenta) is an obligate anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacillus found in the indigenous intestinal microflora of human.1 It can grow as a single organism, in pairs or in short chains. This organism was initially isolated from human faeces and firstly identified by Arnold H. Eggerth in 1935.1 Its original name Eubacterium lentum was changed to E. lenta on the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in 1999, and concurrently transferred to its own distinct genus.2,3 Its complete genomic sequence was first described in 2009.4

E. lenta has been identified as the causative pathogen of bacteremia, sinusitis, appendicitis, decubitus ulcers, spondylodiscitis, splenic abscesses and pelvic abscesses.5,6 The clinical spectrum of the diseases caused by this organism, as well as the risk factors, laboratory examination, diagnosis and antibiotic treatment has not been well described systematically so far, and the cases of E. lenta infection in published literature are scarce. This scarcity may be because the identification of anaerobic bacteria is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and these bacteria are therefore historically less frequently recognized. Herein, we present a case of E. lenta bacteremia in a previously healthy middle-aged male suffering from liver abscess, and conduct a retrospective analysis of 30 sporadic cases of E. lenta infection that were reported in the last 50 years.

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old Chinese male was admitted to our hospital with complaints of right upper quadrant pain and discomfort for one week. His symptoms began approximately one week before admission. His right upper quadrant pain had no obvious predisposing factors. The pain was paroxysmal, accompanied by abdominal fullness and distention and worsened after meals. The patient denied any obvious nausea, vomiting, stiffness, fever and other symptoms. He had no past medical history and had no history of close contact with infected individuals, recent travel or any abdominal trauma. He sought care in a local hospital where he was diagnosed with hepatic abscess and treated with hepatic puncture and drainage 1 day earlier.

The patient and family requested a transfer to our hospital for further treatment. He was afebrile on the day of admission and had a pulse rate of 80 beats/minute, a blood pressure of 118/73 mmHg and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/minute. Laboratory investigation showed a leukocyte count of 16.4×109/L (neutrophil 94.5%), a haemoglobin level of 85 g/L, a platelet count of 240×109/L, a procalcitonin (PCT) level of 2.3 ng/mL and a plasma fibrinogen level of 7.48 g/L. His liver and renal function tests were slightly abnormal; he had a serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase level of 67 U/L, a glutamic-pyruvic transaminase level of 83 U/L, a cholinesterase level of 1360 U/L, total protein and albumin levels of 50.8 and 21.5 g/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 10.8 mmol/L and a creatinine level of 51.3 umol/L. He was negative for HIV and syphilis. However, he had a complaint of obvious abdominal distension with mild bellyache and extreme thirst on day 2, right abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding on exam and a temperature of 36.8 °C. The drainage catheter yield of 150 mL of fulvous fluid was submitted to the microbiology laboratory for analysis. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was immediately performed to evaluate the change in his condition. The CT image (Figure 1 and Figure 1 supplement) shows an irregular, slightly low-density lesion in the right posterior hepatic lobe with a size of 41 mm × 56 mm with an obscured boundary and a gas density shadow inside. A liquid density shadow and high-density drainage tube shadow are present around the lower margin of liver. A round-like low-density lesion of about 0.8 cm in diameter is located in the right lobe of the liver. The appendix thickened to about 20 mm in diameter, and the structure of the ascending colon near the ileocecal region became disorganised. Multiple gas accumulation and dilation in the bowel and air-fluid levels inside the abdomen, which likely represent hepatic abscesses, ileus, mild ascites, appendicitis, liver cyst, abdominal infection and peritonitis, were observed.Figure 1 CT image showing liver abscess, multiple gas accumulation and dilation in the bowel, and retroperitoneal infection. a. Liver abscess; b. Retroperitoneal infection.

The patient presented clinical symptoms of pre-shock, such as insufficient blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, and was taken to the operating room for urgent exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative examination revealed the presence of fulvous purulent exudate and necrotic tissue filled the extraperitoneal space and abdominal cavity, partial postnecrotic defect in the per
