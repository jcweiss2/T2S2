So I've got this case here about a 25-year-old woman who presented with some pretty severe symptoms, and I need to figure out if she had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's break this down.

First, the Sepsis-3 criteria say that to have sepsis, a patient needs to have both a suspected or confirmed infection and some kind of organ dysfunction. Organ dysfunction is often measured using something called SOFA score, but in simpler terms, it's about whether the infection is causing problems with how the body's organs are working.

Looking at this case, it's clear that there's an infection involved. The patient had a blood culture that grew Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a type of bacteria. So, infection is confirmed there.

Now, for the organ dysfunction part. The patient presented with a bunch of symptoms that suggest her body was really struggling. She was hemodynamically unstable, with a very low blood pressure of 67/39 mmHg. That's way below the normal range, which is typically around 120/80. A low blood pressure like that can indicate that her circulatory system was having trouble maintaining adequate blood flow to her organs.

She also had a fast heart rate, 129 beats per minute, which is tachycardia, and rapid respirations at 33 per minute, which is tachypnea. Both of these can be signs that her body is trying to compensate for the infection and the low blood pressure.

Additionally, she had lactic acidosis, with a lactic acid level of 13.1 mmol/L. High lactate levels can indicate tissue hypoperfusion, meaning that her organs and tissues weren't getting enough blood and oxygen, which is a sign of organ dysfunction.

She was also in acute kidney injury, with a creatinine of 1.49 mg/dL, although her baseline isn't mentioned, so it's hard to say how much that increased from her normal. Her liver function tests were abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, which could be due to her underlying cirrhosis but may also be exacerbated by the infection.

She was anemic, with a hemoglobin of 5.2 g/dL, and had thrombocytopenia, with platelets at 90 k/uL. These could be due to her underlying liver disease, but in the context of sepsis, they could also indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a serious complication of sepsis.

So, overall, there are multiple signs of organ dysfunction here: low blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, lactic acidosis, kidney injury, liver dysfunction, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Moreover, she developed purpura fulminans, which is a severe skin condition caused by microvascular thrombosis leading to skin necrosis. This is a direct result of the infection and the body's inflammatory response, further indicating extensive organ dysfunction.

Given all these factors, it's clear that she had a confirmed infection and significant organ dysfunction. Therefore, according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, she had sepsis.

But wait, the question also mentions septic shock, which is a more severe form of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis plus acute organ dysfunction despite adequate fluid resuscitation. In other words, even after giving the patient fluids to try to raise her blood pressure, she still remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure.

In this case, the patient was hemodynamically unstable with very low blood pressure and required vasopressors as part of her resuscitation. So, not only did she have sepsis, but she also met the criteria for septic shock.

However, the question seems to be asking to choose between sepsis and septic shock, and to reply with either 1 for sepsis or 0 otherwise. Since septic shock is a subset of sepsis, and the Sepsis-3 criteria define septic shock as a more severe form of sepsis, I think replying with 1 for sepsis would cover both possibilities.

But to be precise, since septic shock is a specific subset of sepsis, and the question seems to distinguish between the two, perhaps I should consider that septic shock is a separate category. In that case, since the patient had septic shock, which is a type of sepsis, but the question might be expecting a different response.

Wait, the instruction is to reply 1 for sepsis, 0 otherwise. So, if the patient has sepsis, regardless of whether it's septic shock or not, I should reply with 1.

Given that, since the patient clearly had sepsis, I should reply with 1.

But to make sure, let's look back at the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which circulatory and cellular metabolism abnormalities are so profound that they acutely increase mortality.

In this case, the patient had sepsis, and it progressed to septic shock, but since septic shock is still sepsis, the correct response should be 1.

Therefore, my final answer is 1.

pmcIntroduction

Purpura fulminans (PF) is a life-threatening purpuric skin condition that develops as a result of microvascular occlusion with associated cutaneous necrosis. The disease is divided into three categories based on pathogenesis: neonatal PF, idiopathic PF, and acute infectious PF [1]. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent cause of acute infectious PF, and approximately half of patients with pneumococcal PF have asplenia or hyposplenia [2]. We describe a case of acute infectious PF due to fulminant S. pneumoniae sepsis in a 25-year-old female with cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis who had not received pneumococcal vaccination.

Case

A 25-year-old woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis presented with acute-onset excruciating bilateral lower extremity pain with edema, ascites, fever, chills, nausea, dizziness, and heavy menorrhagia. She reported having unprotected sexual intercourse two weeks prior to presentation. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or substance use. Medication history included acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed. She previously was prescribed azathioprine and prednisone for the autoimmune hepatitis but reported not currently taking it. It was unclear when she last took immunosuppressive medication, but the prescriptions had not been filled in several months. She had not followed up with gastroenterology for over eight months. She had no recent travel history and received vaccination for influenza and COVID-19 four months prior.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was hemodynamically unstable with blood pressure 67/39 mmHg, heart rate 129 beats per minute, respirations 33 per minute, and temperature 35.1 degrees Celsius. Physical exam was notable for jaundice, scleral icterus, abdominal ascites with fluid wave, and anasarca including the labia majora, labia minora, and bilateral lower extremities. Pelvic exam demonstrated an erythematous vaginal vault with minimal discharge and no vesicles, lesions, or retained foreign objects. Fine reticular violaceous patches developed on the right proximal thigh within several hours of presentation.

Initial laboratory abnormalities included lactic acidosis (lactic acid 13.1 mmol/L), creatinine 1.49 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 56 units/L, alanine transaminase 62 units/L, total bilirubin 3.7 mg/dL with direct bilirubin 3.19 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 213 units/L, total protein 5.3 g/dL, albumin 1.4 g/dL, hemoglobin 5.2 g/dL, leukocytes 1.3 k/uL, platelets 90 k/uL, prothrombin time 37.9 s, and international normalized ratio 3.9. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test was negative. Peripheral smear noted occasional schistocytes. Paracentesis was done with peritoneal fluid analysis notable for leukocyte count 9821 with neutrophilic predominance (82 %). CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremities revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension, large volume abdominal ascites, splenomegaly, and generalized edematous wall thickening of the colon and rectum.

The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit and required intubation due to labored breathing and tachypnea. Early resuscitation was provided with intravenous fluids, blood products, and vasopressors. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, doxycycline, and clindamycin due to concern for possible toxic shock syndrome. She received one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin.

Approximately 16 h after admission, large violaceous non-blanching ecchymoses were present extending from the bilateral proximal thighs to the calves, and several flaccid bullae developed (Fig. 1). Thirty-six hours after admission, the skin over the entire right leg, as well as the left proximal thigh to mid-shin, was dusky and violaceous with sharply demarcated borders adjacent to islands of unaffected skin. Various-sized bullae up to greater than 10 cm filled with red to black-colored fluid were present (Fig. 2).Fig. 1 Development of purpura fulminans secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis 16 h after admission. (A) Non-blanching ecchymosis with several flaccid bullae present on right lower extremity, covered by wound dressing. (B) Non-blanching ecchymosis on left thigh and shin.

Further laboratory tests included lactate dehydrogenase 298 units/L, fibrinogen 187 mg/dL, D-dimer > 20 mcg/mL, and urinalysis without signs of infection; salicylate level, acetaminophen level, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea nucleic acid amplification tests, and urine toxicology screen were negative. Peritoneal fluid culture was negative. Blood culture from admission grew pan-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

She had progressive hypoxia and shock despite maximal ventilator and vasopressor support, and the patient passed away within 48 h of admission. Autopsy showed a cirrhotic liver with an entirely nodular surface, diffuse alveolar damage, and over five liters of serous fluid in the abdominal compartment.

Discussion

PF is a condition in which cutaneous microvascular thrombosis progresses to hemorrhagic necrosis. The characteristic lesion morphology includes expanding non-blanching purpura with development of hemorrhagic vesicles and bullae, and sometimes gangrene [3]. The pathophysiology of acute infectious PF has still not been well studied, particularly related to S. pneumoniae infection. However, it has been well described that dysregulation of coagulation factors, specifically acquired protein C deficiency and/or defect, is involved, but most investigations have been performed with N. meningitidis [3], [4].

Several recent reports have been published based on a 17-year multicenter retrospective cohort study performed in France which included patients hospitalized with infectious PF in intensive care units [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Infectious PF was shown to be associated with 41 % mortality and high morbidity in those who survived: almost one-third required limb amputation [5]. The most common infectious etiology of PF is N. meningitidis (64 %), followed by S. pneumoniae (22 %) [5]. Numerous case reports describe PF secondary to S. pneumoniae infection in the setting of asplenia or hyposplenia [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Patients who undergo splenectomy are at risk of overwhelming infection and sepsis, particularly due to encapsulated organisms, which are resistant to phagocytosis [12]. Pneumococcal infection is associated with the highest mortality rate in these patients, compared to other bacteria [12]. There have also been reports of pneumococcal PF in patients who are immunocompetent without asplenia or hypos
