I have a case report here about a patient with Chryseobacterium bacteraemia, and I need to determine if the patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. The Sepsis-3 criteria define sepsis as a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes organ dysfunction. It requires two elements: (1) a suspected or confirmed infection and (2) organ dysfunction, which is often assessed using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or other clinical indicators like blood pressure, respiratory rate, and mental status abnormalities.

In this case, the patient was diagnosed with Chryseobacterium bacteraemia, which is a confirmed infection since Chryseobacterium was isolated from blood cultures. So, the first criterion is met.

Now, I need to look for evidence of organ dysfunction or other signs of sepsis. The case mentions that the patient presented to the emergency department with septic shock, and the PICC line was removed. He was started on IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and transferred to the intensive care unit for vasopressor support. This suggests that he had hypotension requiring vasopressors, which is a key feature of septic shock.

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis where there is persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure, and there is usually evidence of inadequate tissue perfusion.

Given that the patient was in septic shock, which is a more severe form of sepsis, it's clear that he met the criteria for sepsis.

However, the question asks specifically to determine if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Since septic shock is a subset of sepsis with more specific hemodynamic criteria, I need to see if the information provided confirms septic shock.

The case states that the patient was in septic shock and required vasopressor support. This directly indicates that he had septic shock.

But the instruction is to reply with 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, without any explanation. Since septic shock is a form of sepsis, I suppose that counts as sepsis. However, to be precise, septic shock is a more severe form.

Looking back at the Sepsis-3 definitions:

- Sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

- Septic shock: a subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities.

Given that, septic shock is a type of sepsis, so if a patient has septic shock, they automatically have sepsis.

Therefore, the answer should be 1 for sepsis.

But to be thorough, I should check if there's any information that might suggest the patient did not have sepsis or septic shock.

The case clearly states that the patient presented with septic shock, had a confirmed infection (Chryseobacterium bacteraemia), and required vasopressors. There doesn't seem to be any contradiction to this.

So, my final answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]

You are an expert physician.  Determine if the patient described in the following case report has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities.
If the information is not present, use your best judgment based on the information available.
Reply 1 for sepsis, 0 otherwise. Reply with the number 0 or 1 only in the \boxed{\n TEXT HERE \n} with no explanation. Here is the case:
Learning points
Patient populations at risk for Chryseobacterium bacteraemia include those who have an indwelling vascular line or device, have existing medical comorbidities, or who are immunocompromised.

Empiric treatment options for Chryseobacterium bacteraemia include fluoroquinolones or piperacillin/tazobactam.




Introduction

Chryseobacterium is a rare human pathogen, but is becoming an emerging cause of bacteraemia in patients with indwelling lines or catheters.1 It is important to recognize this given our increasingly complex patient population who are not infrequently discharged with vascular access devices. Additionally, one should be able to understand empiric treatment options should this be encountered. We report what we believe to be the first case of Chryseobacterium bacteraemia in a patient on chronic home inotropic therapy and systematically review the literature.

Case presentation
A 29-year-old male with biventricular failure due to non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy secondary to myopericarditis with features of constrictive pericarditis, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II symptoms, on home milrinone, presented to the Emergency Department with fevers/chills.

He was initially hospitalized in September 2018 for progressive fatigue and dyspnoea on exertion for 2–3 months. He had an extensive workup and was diagnosed with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to viral myopericarditis. A computed tomography angiography of the coronary arteries revealed cardiomegaly, a dilated right atrium, passive hepatic congestion suggesting right ventricular failure, pericardial calcification, but no evidence of constrictive pericarditis. However, an echocardiogram showed biventricular failure and features of constrictive pericarditis. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 23%, right ventricular EF of 36%, and delayed gadolinium enhancement demonstrating scarring/fibrosis of the subepicardial basal inferior and basal inferolateral wall. This was in a non-coronary artery disease hyperenhancement pattern, without evidence of an infiltrative process, most consistent with prior myocarditis. Additionally, there was a diastolic septal bounce and a concentrically thickened pericardium supporting constriction. His stay was complicated by atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response requiring radiofrequency ablation, and cardiogenic shock. For this, he was ultimately stabilized on inotrope therapy and was discharged on home milrinone infusion via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line). Following this hospitalization, he was seen by cardiothoracic surgery as an outpatient and had plans for an elective pericardiectomy in early November due to his symptom burden. At that visit, it was discussed that his heart function may or may not ever recover following the operation.

In November 2018, days prior to his elective pericardiectomy, he was re-admitted with a fever of 38.7°C (101.8°F) and chills for 1 day at home. He had no other complaints. Home medications on admission consisted of furosemide 40 mg once daily, losartan 12.5 mg once daily, metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg once daily, milrinone 0.25 μg/kg/min, and spironolactone 12.5 mg once daily. Initial vitals were significant for fever of 38.7°C (101.8°F), tachycardia with a heart rate in the 110 s, and a blood pressure of 96/57 mmHg. Exam was pertinent for a heart that was tachycardic, but normal rhythm without any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There were no signs of elevated jugular venous pressure and he did not have lower extremity oedema. His bilateral radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were equal and 2+ bilaterally. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally in the anterior and posterior lung fields with a normal work of breathing. There was no redness or drainage around the PICC line. Chest X-ray showed no abnormalities. The electrocardiogram was significant for sinus tachycardia, normal axis, RSR′ pattern in V1, QRS duration of 90 ms, and non-specific T wave flattening in the inferolateral leads. Upon removal of his PICC line, he became febrile to 39.5°C (103.1°F) and developed severe rigours as well as hypotension with blood pressure in 70 s/40s mmHg, and an elevated lactate level of 5.5 mmol/L. Blood cultures were drawn both peripherally and from the PICC line. He was started on empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for vasopressor support to treat septic shock arising from a catheter-related bloodstream infection. The advanced heart failure service was consulted to help guide his care, with plans for an eventual pericardiectomy once stabilized.

Preliminary report of his blood cultures revealed Gram-negative rods which later speciated as Chryseobacterium indologenes. The cultures drawn from the PICC line became positive for growth hours before peripheral blood cultures, suggesting the PICC line as the most likely source of infection. Given the rarity of this pathogen, the infectious disease team was consulted for guidance. Due to this bacteria’s expected susceptibility in the literature to fluoroquinolones and piperacillin/tazobactam, he was started on ciprofloxacin in place of the vancomycin and continued on piperacillin/tazobactam.2 Susceptibility testing on the isolated C. indologenes demonstrated sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and resistance to meropenem.

He improved clinically on treatment with antibiotics, remained afebrile, and was able to be weaned off vasopressor support. His follow-up blood cultures remained negative. An interval echocardiogram showed a dilated and hypertrophied left ventricle with a diastolic septal bounce consistent with constrictive pericarditis, and an EF of 30–35%. The right ventricle was dilated with reduced systolic function. There was no evidence of valvular stenosis, regurgitation, or vegetations. Additionally, a simultaneous right and left heart catheterization demonstrated discordance of the right and left ventricular pressures as well as diastolic equalization of pressures supporting the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis (Table 1).
