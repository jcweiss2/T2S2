I have a case report here about a patient with an obturator internus muscle (OIM) and adductor brevis abscess. The patient had a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) impetigo and a right tibia fracture treated with intramedullary fixation. A year later, the interlocking screws were removed due to skin irritation and pain. Two weeks after that, the patient was diagnosed with a stitch abscess at the surgical site, which was positive for MRSA. He was treated with oral antibiotics and discharged.

Three months later, the patient returned to the ER with fever and right groin pain and was discharged with a diagnosis of viral infection. A week after that, he returned again with a systemic fever of 39°C, myalgia, difficulty walking, right forearm cellulitis, sudden onset uveitis, systemic rash, and right hip lymphadenopathy.

Lab tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 30 mg/dL and white blood cell (WBC) count of 14,000, indicating an acute infection. Hepatic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were also elevated. A hip X-ray was unremarkable.

He was started on IV antibiotics for MRSA cellulitis, but his condition worsened. A PET-CT scan revealed OIM abscess with systemic manifestations, and blood cultures were positive for MRSA. He showed signs of hemodynamic deterioration, suggestive of fulminant MRSA sepsis, and was admitted to the ICU. Ultrasound-guided drainage didn't improve his condition, and a subsequent CT scan showed enlargement of the abscess.

After multidisciplinary discussion, a surgical intervention was planned using a combined Smith-Peterson and modified Stoppa approach to drain the abscesses. Post-surgery, his condition improved, with less frequent fever spikes and decreasing CRP and WBC levels. He received additional antibiotic treatment for six weeks and recovered well, returning to normal activities.

Now, I need to determine if this patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sepsis is defined as suspected or confirmed infection with organ dysfunction, which is indicated by an increase in the Sequential [something] Response Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more likely, in this case, by criteria such as altered mental status, acute change in mental status, or hypotension not improved with fluid resuscitation.

Looking at the patient's presentation, he had a suspected infection, given the history of MRSA and the abscesses, and he had elevated inflammatory markers like CRP and WBC. He also had a fever of 39°C, which is indicative of infection.

Moreover, he had multi-organ involvement: cellulitis, uveitis, rash, and lymphadenopathy, suggesting systemic involvement. His condition led to hemodynamic deterioration, requiring ICU admission, which suggests that there was organ dysfunction due to the infection.

However, the specific criteria for sepsis in Sepsis-3 include the presence of infection and an increase in SOFA score of 2 points or more, which is a measure of organ dysfunction. Since the SOFA score isn't provided, I need to look for other signs of organ dysfunction.

The patient had a fever, elevated CRP and WBC, which are signs of infection, but to meet the criteria for sepsis, there needs to be evidence of organ dysfunction. The hemodynamic deterioration and need for ICU admission suggest that there was some degree of organ dysfunction, possibly due to sepsis.

But to confirm septic shock, there would need to be hypotension that persists despite fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure, and having a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L that requires treatment.

In this case, it's mentioned that the patient had hemodynamic deterioration, but there's no specific mention of blood pressure readings or the need for vasopressors. Therefore, it's not clear if he met the criteria for septic shock.

Given the information provided, it seems that the patient had sepsis due to the presence of infection and evidence of organ dysfunction, but it's not明确 whether he progressed to septic shock.

However, since the instruction is to determine if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria, and to reply with 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, in a boxed format with no explanation, I need to make a judgment call based on the available data.

Considering that the patient had a confirmed infection (MRSA abscesses) and signs of organ dysfunction (fever, elevated inflammatory markers, multi-organ involvement, and hemodynamic deterioration requiring ICU admission), it's reasonable to conclude that he had sepsis.

Therefore, my answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]

You are an expert physician.  Determine if the patient described in the following case report has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities.
If the information is not present, use your best judgment based on the information available.
Reply 1 for sepsis, 0 otherwise. Reply with the number 0 or 1 only in the \boxed{\n TEXT HERE \n} with no explanation. Here is the case:
Introduction
Abscess in the obturator internus muscle (OIM) and adductor brevis (AB) is a rare condition, usually affecting children after trauma or muscular effort. Primary infection of muscles commonly occurs in many parts of Africa and the South Pacific and is often referred to as ‘tropical disease’.

Most patients present non-specific symptoms: fever, hip pain, inability to bear weight, elevated C-reactive-protein (CRP) and increased white blood cell (WBC) count. Physical examination also shows a limited range of motion at the hip joint among most of the patients [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]].

Because of its rarity in non-tropical areas and lack of specific symptoms, OIM diagnosis is often overlooked and delayed, leading to severe complications and difficulty in treatments [1,2,8,9]. Such complications may include extension into and destruction of an adjacent joint, compartment syndrome, sepsis, and even death [10,11].

A history of trauma or intense exercise is the most common presumed aetiology [2,3,12,13]. About 21%–66% of OIM cases have a history of local trauma.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cultured microorganism causing a bacterial infection. Besides, Enterococcus faecalis and Neisseria gonorrhoea have also been reported as infectious agents [[4], [5], [6]].

Initial therapy usually involves systemic antibiotics alone, with an estimated successful outcome of 67%. Antibiotic treatment usually lasts about 2–6 weeks [10]. In refractory cases, open or closed surgical drainage must be considered.

Case presentation
A 23-year-old male with a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) impetigo at the forearm and right tibia fracture treated with intramedullary fixation (IMN). A year later, he had his interlocking screws removed due to skin irritation and pain. Two weeks later, he was referred to the emergency room (ER) due to redness and swelling at the surgical site and was diagnosed with stitch abscess. Cultures from the surgical site were positive for MRSA. The patient was prescribed an oral antibiotic treatment and discharged home.

Three months later, he returned to the ER with a fever and right groin pain and then discharged home with the diagnosis of viral infection. A week later, he returned to the ER with a systemic fever (39 °C), myalgia, difficult and painful ambulation, right forearm cellulitis, right sudden onset uveitis, systemic rash, and right hip lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory investigation revealed increased CRP (30 mg/dL, normal <0.5) level and WBC (14,000, normal <10,000) count, indicating an acute infection. Hepatic enzymes, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were also elevated. A radiograph of both hips in anterior-posterior view was unremarkable.

The patient was advised to start the treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics that work against MRSA to treat cellulitis. His medical condition continued to deteriorate. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan was conducted and revealed OIM abscess with systemic manifestations [Fig. 1, Fig. 2]. Blood cultures were positive for MRSA bacteria. The patient showed signs of hemodynamic deterioration, a clinical picture appropriate for fulminant MRSA sepsis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and underwent ultrasound-guided drainage without improvement. Three days later, he underwent a full-body CT scan, the result showed further enlargement of the abscesses diameter. The patient's general health condition continued to deteriorate with persistent fever, CRP level of 36 mg/dL and WBC count of 20,000.Fig. 1 CT axial scan

After consulting the orthopaedic team as a part of a comprehensive multidisciplinary discussion, surgical intervention was considered. A special surgical plan was developed. Based on CT scan findings and the comprehensive surgical planning, a combined approach of Smith-Peterson and modified Stoppa was chosen as the most suitable intervention to access and drain the abscesses [Fig. 3, Fig. 4]. This approach is usually used for treating complex fractures of the acetabulum and hips.Fig. 3 Stoppa approach, showing the medial wall of the abscess.

Right after surgery, his general condition was improving, and less frequent fever spikes were noticed. Additionally, there was a decrease in CRP and WBC levels after additional antibiotic treatment support for 6 weeks. Two months later, the patient showed signs of almost complete recovery. He was able to ambulate normally without any pain or functional limitations and returned to his daily activities.

Surgical technique
General anaesthesia with muscle relaxant was administered to the patient. He was positioned supine with a bump and the knee to flex the thigh and to relax the iliopsoas muscle. The contralateral pelvic was elevated to 20 degrees.

First, a decision was made to go through the medial side of the abscess by the Stoppa approach then the lateral sides was addressed by the anterior approach of the hip (Smith-Peterson).

Stoppa described his approach first in 1973 as a subperitoneal medial approach for the treatment of groin hernias. In 1994, Cole and Bonhoeffer described the Stoppa approach and directed the surgeon to stand at the opposite side of the involved hip joint during reduction and fixation of the acetabular fractures, allowing for direct visualisation of the medial wall, dome, and quadrilateral plate.

Surgical landmarks are similar to the Pfannenstiel approach. The surgical incision is made 2 cm proximal to the symphysis pubis in transverse fashion with the length extending approximately 4 cm from the external ring on the fractured side to the contralateral side. Then the rectus abdominis muscles are split vertically from inferior to superior with care taken to maintain the proximal portion to be extraperitoneal. A sharp dissection of the rectus abdominis from superior ramps of the pelvic bone is carried out, exposing the symphysis body and pubic ramus. The rectus and the femoral neurovascular structures are subsequently retracted laterally and anteriorly so that they are protected. The iliopectineal fascia is released to enter the true pelvis. Anastomoses between the external iliac and obturator vessels (corona mortis) should be identified along the superior pubic ramus and ligated.

Thereafter, the iliopsoas can be visualised and elevated. A retractor is used to retract the iliopsoas and external iliac vessels. The entire pelvic brim should be visualised at this time. Soon after, the obturator neurovascular bundle will be exposed and protected as the quadrilateral surface and posterior column are dissected [Fig. 2, Fig. 5, Fig. 6] [14]. This approach allows to fall directly on the medial side of the abscess and to perform drainage and debridement of the OIM and lavage for the pelvic brim.Fig. 5 (a,b): schematic for Stoppa approach:

The Smith-Peterson approach to the hip was first described by Carl Hueter, a German surgeon. Peterson was credited with spreading the use of the anterior approach in the English-speaking world. It is widely used for total hip arthroplasty. As it takes the advantage of an interval between the sartorial muscle and the tensor fascia latae muscle as superficial dissection, then between rectus femoris and gluteus medius as a deep dissection. The rectus femoris is first detached from its both origins. Then, rectus femoris and iliopsoas are retracted medially and gluteus medius is retracted laterally to expose the hip capsule [15,16] [Fig. 7]. This approach helps visualise and examine the hip, thus facilitating the drainage of the lateral sided of the abscess and adductor brevis muscle
