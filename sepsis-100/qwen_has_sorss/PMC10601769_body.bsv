I've got this case report to read and determine if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. So, first things first, I need to understand what Sepsis-3 is all about.

From what I recall, Sepsis-3 is the latest definition of sepsis, and it was introduced in 2016 to provide a more accurate and clinically relevant definition. According to Sepsis-3, sepsis is defined as "life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection." They introduced the concept of Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to quantify organ dysfunction.

But in this case, I need to use the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a suspected or confirmed infection and some blood pressure, respiratory rate, or mental status abnormalities. So, probably, they are referring to the quick SOFA (qSOFA) criteria, which is a simplified version used to identify patients at risk of having sepsis.

qSOFA consists of three clinical criteria:

1. Altered mental status

2. Systolic blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg

3. Respiratory rate ≥22 breaths per minute

If a patient has one or more of these criteria along with a suspected infection, it suggests they may have sepsis and should be further evaluated.

Septic shock is a more severe form of sepsis, defined as sepsis-induced hypotension that requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg and has a serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

So, in this case, I need to look for signs of infection and any of the qSOFA criteria to determine if the patient has sepsis. If there's evidence of hypotension requiring vasopressors and elevated lactate, it would be septic shock.

Now, let's dive into the case report.

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of stage IIIA lung cancer diagnosed 27 months prior. She presented with abdominal pain and a pancreatic head lesion found on CT scan.

Her past medical history includes hypertension, hypothyroidism, and dyslipidemia, and she's a heavy smoker with over 40 pack-years.

Looking back, she was initially diagnosed with stage IIIA NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinoma, in the right upper lobe. She underwent planned surgical resection, but it was aborted due to encasement of the pulmonary artery and superior vena cava. She then received 7 rounds of carboplatin and paclitaxel and 8 rounds of radiation therapy.

After that, she received 3 rounds of adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab but had to discontinue due to pneumonitis.

On follow-up, her lung mass increased in size, but no distant metastasis was noted until August 2022 when an abdominal CT showed a mass in the pancreatic head.

She underwent an endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy, which showed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to the pancreas.

At the time of endoscopy, her liver enzymes were normal, as was her bilirubin. CA 19.9 was 22.5 U/mL, which is within normal limits.

A PET/CT scan showed an FDG-avid mass in the pancreatic head with SUVmax of 13.3 and increased uptake in the porta hepatis, but no other metastases were noted.

A brain MRI was negative for intracranial metastasis.

Given that she was a poor surgical candidate, she received palliative radiation therapy to the pancreatic mass and then combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed, completing three cycles by December 2022.

In December 2022, she was admitted for generalized weakness and dyspnea at rest. She had electrolyte derangements and acute anemia requiring transfusion. A CT scan showed a new 9 mm left lower lobe nodule.

In February 2023, a PET/CT showed decreased metabolic activity in the pancreatic mass but metabolic activity in the new left lower lobe nodule.

The patient expressed uncertainty about continuing treatment due to fatigue, and no further treatments were given after the third cycle in December 2022.

In March 2023, during a pulmonology clinic visit, she became hypoxic, with SpO2 of 87% on 3 L NC, used accessory muscles, had BP 84/70, and HR 138. She reported increased dyspnea, cough, and generalized weakness.

She was taken to the ED and admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the context of sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started: vancomycin, azithromycin, and cefepime. She was initiated on bilevel positive airway pressure for oxygen supplementation.

On day 6 of admission, she had an episode of altered mentation and worsening hypoxemia, leading to a critical care consult. She required vasopressor support and continued bilevel PAP.

The palliative care team was consulted, and the family agreed to transition to inpatient hospice care. The patient passed away on day 8 of admission.

Okay, so the question is whether this patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria.

First, was there a suspected or confirmed infection? The clinical presentation suggests pneumonia as the cause of her respiratory failure and sepsis.

In the hospital admission, she had increased dyspnea, cough, generalized weakness, hypoxia, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. The clinical team diagnosed her with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

So, there is a suspected infection—pneumonia.

Now, let's look for the qSOFA criteria:

1. Altered mental status: The patient had an episode of altered mentation on day 6 of admission.

2. Systolic blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg: Her blood pressure was 84/70 at the time of her decompensation.

3. Respiratory rate ≥22 breaths per minute: The exact respiratory rate isn't provided, but she was in acute respiratory failure requiring bilevel PAP, so it's likely that her respiratory rate was elevated.

Given that she met at least two qSOFA criteria (altered mental status and systolic BP ≤100 mm Hg), along with a suspected infection, she meets the criteria for sepsis.

Furthermore, she required vasopressor support due to hypotension, which suggests that she may have progressed to septic shock.

However, the case report doesn't specify whether her hypotension responded to fluid resuscitation or if her lactate levels were measured and elevated.

But given that she required vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure, and she was in septic shock, it's reasonable to conclude that she had septic shock.

But according to the instruction, I need to determine if she has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria, replying with 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise.

Given that she had a suspected infection and met the qSOFA criteria, she has sepsis. Additionally, since she required vasopressors for hypotension, she likely had septic shock.

But since the question is to reply 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, and considering that septic shock is a subset of sepsis, I should answer 1 for sepsis.

However, to be precise, septic shock is a more severe form of sepsis, and according to Sepsis-3, septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory failure and metabolic acidosis despite fluid resuscitation.

Given that she required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, it suggests circulatory failure, which is consistent with septic shock.

But since the instruction is to reply 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, and considering that septic shock is included in sepsis, I should answer 1.

But perhaps I should consider that septic shock is a separate category. Maybe I need to differentiate between sepsis and septic shock.

Wait, the instruction says: "determine if the patient has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities."

So, it seems like they are considering sepsis as having infection plus organ dysfunction (qSOFA), and septic shock as a subset of sepsis with specific hemodynamic criteria.

But the instruction is to reply 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, so perhaps they just want to know if she has sepsis, regardless of whether it's septic shock or not.

Given that, since she has sepsis, I should answer 1.

But to be thorough, I should consider if she only has sepsis or if she has septic shock.

According to Sepsis-3, sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock is a subset of sepsis with circulatory failure and metabolic acidosis despite fluid resuscitation.

In this case, the patient had suspected pneumonia leading to acute hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension requiring vasopressors, and was in need of mechanical ventilation support.

Therefore, she not only had sepsis but also met the criteria for septic shock.

However, since the instruction is to reply 1 for sepsis and 0 otherwise, and not specifying to differentiate between sepsis and septic shock, I should answer 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the "otherwise" includes septic shock as part of sepsis.

Given that, I think the answer should be 1.

pmcIntroduction

Treatment of advanced and metastatic lung cancer places significant emphasis on molecular testing, with the development of specific guidelines in this regard. These molecular tests allow the possibility for targeted therapies directed at specific molecular abnormalities driving carcinogenesis. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), the most common driver mutations involve exon 19 deletions and exon 21 point mutations. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors stand as the first line of defense for these epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations [1, 2].

In more recent times, several studies have shown that incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into treatment regimen confers improved outcomes including survival and treatment response outcomes [3, 4]. Moreso, ICIs are heralded as the first-line monotherapy in advanced and metastatic NSCLC with high checkpoint expression (>50%) and without targetable EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations [5]. Even in the absence of immune checkpoint expression, survival benefits have been shown with combination therapy including an ICI along with traditional chemotherapy, with or without antiangiogenesis drugs, compared with standard chemotherapy regimen alone [6]. Nevertheless, the use of these relatively newer drugs is limited by similar constraints associated with traditional chemotherapy, notably, patient tolerability due to adverse effects, which may in turn limit the ability for long enough treatment to achieve substantial response [7, 8].

Extra-thoracic metastasis of lung cancer is most commonly to the bones, liver, adrenal gland, and intrabdominal lymph nodes [9]. Pancreatic metastasis is commonly associated with diffuse metastatic disease [10, 11] and when metastasis occurs from a lung primary, it is most frequently from small cell lung cancers [12]. Pancreatic metastasis from lung primaries is a rare occurrence, with one study showing that only 1% of non-small cell lung cancers result in pancreatic metastasis [13]. This case concerns a patient with a primary lung adenocarcinoma with an isolated and solitary metastatic pancreatic head mass.

Case Report

A 65-year-old female patient with a history of stage IIIA lung cancer diagnosed 27 months prior, presented to the oncology clinic with reports of abdominal pain and a pancreatic head lesion found on abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan at a non-affiliated hospital in August 2022.

The patient had a substantial smoking history of greater than 40 pack years, along with hypertension, hypothyroidism, and dyslipidemia. Twenty-seven months before these new abdominal symptoms, the patient was found to have a spiculated suprahilar 4.5 × 2.6 cm right upper lobe (RUL) nodule on a screening low-dose CT scan and multiple sub-centimeter left lung nodules consistent with lung-RADS 4X. A positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scan showed augmented activity in the RUL mass. Bronchoscopy-attained tissue sample showed that the RUL mass was a NSCLC, consistent with adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1a–c). Lymph node sampling was negative for nodal involvement, consistent with stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma (T4N0M0). Program death ligand-1 expression was 15% (April 2020). Surgical resection
