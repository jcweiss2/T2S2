I have a case report here about a patient who underwent carinal resection and left pneumonectomy due to adenoid cystic carcinoma. The surgery involved one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the lateral position, and there were some complications with severe hypoxemia during non-dependent OLV. The medical team managed to improve oxygenation by ligating the pulmonary artery of the dependent lung.

Now, I need to determine if this patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes organ dysfunction. It requires two elements: (1) a suspected or confirmed infection and (2) organ dysfunction, which is often assessed using the Sequential [Sepsis-Related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.

Looking at the case report, I see that the patient had a malignant tumor, adenoid cystic carcinoma in the carina, which was being treated surgically. There's no mention of any infection before or during the surgery. The complications described are related to the surgical positioning and ventilation strategies, leading to hypoxemia, but not to an infection.

Therefore, since there's no indication of a suspected or confirmed infection, the patient does not meet the criteria for sepsis or septic shock.

So, my answer is 0.

In the case report you provided, the patient underwent a complex surgery for carinal resection and left pneumonectomy due to adenoid cystic carcinoma. The surgery involved one-lung ventilation (OLV) in the lateral position, and there were complications with severe hypoxemia during non-dependent OLV, which was managed by ligating the pulmonary artery of the dependent lung.
