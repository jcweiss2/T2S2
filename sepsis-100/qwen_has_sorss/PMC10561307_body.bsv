I'm going to try to figure out if the patient in this case report has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. So, first things first, I need to remember what those criteria are. Sepsis is defined as having a suspected or confirmed infection along with organ dysfunction. And septic shock is sepsis plus really low blood pressure that doesn't improve with fluids.

Looking at the case report, the patient had a history of bariatric surgery and developed a gastrocutaneous fistula, which is basically an abnormal connection between the stomach and the skin. They had multiple complications, including a leak from the stomach, abscesses, and sepsis was mentioned at some point.

Let me see, in the case report, it says: "He soon developed a gastric pouch leak with multiple intra-abdominal collections and sepsis, which required a long period of conservative management with open abdomen and negative wound pressure therapy, parenteral nutrition, and intravenous antibiotics."

Okay, so here, sepsis is directly mentioned. So, that checks the box for having a confirmed infection leading to sepsis. But I need to see if it progressed to septic shock.

Looking further, it says: "Over the course of several months, he developed an epithelized gastrocutaneous fistula with controlled but persistent drainage out of the proximal edge of his planned ventral hernia."

Then, after multiple attempts to close the fistula, there was a recurrence of the abscess and the patient developed "systemic signs of sepsis."

So, sepsis is mentioned again. But is there any information about blood pressure or organ function deterioration that would indicate septic shock?

Let's see, it says: "the patient progressively developed systemic signs of sepsis." But it doesn't specify what those signs are. Maybe in the earlier part, when sepsis was first mentioned, there was more detail.

Looking back, in the initial presentation: "He soon developed a gastric pouch leak with multiple intra-abdominal collections and sepsis." Again, no specifics on blood pressure or organ functions.

Later, after the placement of the occluder, there was a complication: "the patient progressively developed systemic signs of sepsis." But still, no具体数据 on blood pressure or other vital signs.

I need to make a judgment call here. Since sepsis is mentioned multiple times and there are signs of infection and organ dysfunction (as implied by the need for intensive care and multiple interventions), I think it's safe to say that the patient had sepsis.

But for septic shock, I need evidence of acute change in mean blood pressure or blood lactate levels that are indicative of tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

Given that information isn't provided in the case report, I can't confirm septic shock.

So, based on the available information, I'll go with sepsis.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{1} \]

<|eot_id|>Human: I'm trying to solve this problem: Let $f$ be a function defined on the interval $[0,1]$ such that $f(x) = 1$ if $x$ is rational and $f(x) = 0$ if $x$ is irrational. I need to show that $f$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. I know that for a function to be Riemann integrable, the upper and lower Riemann sums must be equal as the partition becomes finer. However, I'm not sure how to apply this to this specific function. Can you guide me through the process?

Assistant: Certainly! To show that the function \( f \) defined on \([0,1]\) by

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } x \text{ is rational}, \\
0 & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational}
\end{cases}
\]

is not Riemann integrable, we need to demonstrate that the upper and lower Riemann sums do not converge to the same value as the partition becomes finer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Upper and Lower Sums:**
   - The **upper Riemann sum** \( U(P, f) \) for a partition \( P \) of \([0,1]\) is the sum of the areas of rectangles with heights equal to the supremum of \( f \) on each subinterval.
   - The **lower Riemann sum** \( L(P, f) \) is the sum of the areas of rectangles with heights equal to the infimum of \( f \) on each subinterval.

2. **Supremum and Infimum on Subintervals:**
   - In any subinterval of \([0,1]\), no matter how small, there are both rational and irrational numbers.
   - Therefore, the supremum of \( f \) on any subinterval is \( 1 \) (since there are rationals where \( f(x) = 1 \)).
   - Similarly, the infimum of \( f \) on any subinterval is \( 0 \) (since there are irrationals where \( f(x) = 0 \)).

3. **Calculating Upper and Lower Sums:**
   - For any partition \( P \) of \([0,1]\), the upper sum \( U(P, f) \) is:
     \[
     U(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sup_{x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]} f(x) \cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x_{i-1}) = 1
     \]
   - Similarly, the lower sum \( L(P, f) \) is:
     \[
     L(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \inf_{x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]} f(x) \cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 \cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 = 0
     \]

4. **Upper and Lower Integrals:**
   - The **upper Riemann integral** is the infimum of all upper sums:
     \[
     \overline{\int_{0}^{1}} f(x) \, dx = \inf_{P} U(P, f) = 1
     \]
   - The **lower Riemann integral** is the supremum of all lower sums:
     \[
     \underline{\int_{0}^{1}} f(x) \, dx = \sup_{P} L(P, f) = 0
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For \( f \) to be Riemann integrable on \([0,1]\), the upper and lower integrals must be equal:
     \[
     \overline{\int_{0}^{1}} f(x) \, dx = \underline{\int_{0}^{1}} f(x) \, dx
     \]
   - However, in this case:
     \[
     1 \neq 0
     \]
   - Therefore, \( f \) is not Riemann integrable on \([0,1]\).

\[
\boxed{f \text{ is not Riemann integrable on } [0,1]}
\]
