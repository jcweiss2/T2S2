So I've got this case to look at, and I need to figure out if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's see what I need to check.

First, according to Sepsis-3, to have sepsis, the patient needs to have two things:

1. A suspected or confirmed infection.

2. Organ dysfunction due to that infection.

And for septic shock, it's sepsis plus:

- Persistent hypotension that needs extra fluid to manage.

So, let's look at the case.

The patient is a 22-year-old man who had mild COVID-19 in October, recovered, and then got vaccinated with the Sinopharm inactivated vaccine in November and December.

After the second dose, he started having symptoms like headache, fatigue, fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash.

He went to the emergency department with high fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash. He also had a dry cough but no shortness of breath or chest discomfort.

In the ER, his vitals were: temperature 39°C, systolic BP 110 mmHg, heart rate 140 bpm. Physical exam showed dry mucous membranes, congested throat, conjunctival injection and hemorrhage, generalized rash on chest and back, no enlarged lymph nodes, no cardiac murmurs, clear lungs, and unremarkable abdomen.

Lab tests:

- WBC: 15 x10^9/L

- Platelets: 122 x10^9/L

- Creatinine: 115 µmol/L

- AST: 53 U/L

- ALT: 81 U/L

- Direct bilirubin: 35 µmol/L

- Albumin: 16 g/L

- CRP: 249 mg/L

- Ferritin: 4357 ng/mL

- D-dimer: 14 mg/mL

- Procalcitonin: 9 ng/mL

- IL-6: 90 pg/mL

SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative, but IgG was strongly positive at 345 AU/mL.

Throat swab for group A strep was negative, sputum culture showed mixed flora, and blood cultures were negative.

Urinalysis showed proteinuria >300 µg.

Autoimmune markers (ANA, dsDNA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA) were negative, but C3 and C4 were reduced.

He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, treated empirically for sepsis with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, plus IV fluids and hydrocortisone 100 mg BID for two days.

His BP stabilized, but fever persisted. He developed facial puffiness and generalized edema, remained tachycardic, had persistent diarrhea, and had difficulty mobilizing due to myalgia and anasarca.

Further workup showed renal impairment with proteinuria, ECG showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, troponin I was 0.29 ng/mL, and pro-BNP was >8000 pg/mL.

Echocardiogram showed severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension (PASP 46 mmHg), moderate dilation of RA and RV, normal LV systolic function, and a thin rim of pericardial effusion.

CT chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed bilateral moderate pleural effusion and basal atelectasis.

All cultures were negative, and other workup was unrevealing.

After achieving relative hemodynamic stability, hydrocortisone was stopped and he was shifted to the medical ward.

Fever recurred, and considering the multisystem involvement and raised inflammatory markers, the diagnosis of MIS-A (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults) was considered.

He was treated with dexamethasone 6 mg IV daily, and his condition improved markedly. Edema subsided, rash and conjunctivitis resolved, WBC count normalized, renal function improved, inflammatory markers came down.

Repeat echocardiogram showed trace tricuspid regurgitation, improved RV function, normal RA and RV size, and normalized PASP.

He was discharged on oral prednisolone tapering over two weeks and had a normal follow-up echocardiogram two weeks later, with residual fatigue.

Okay, so now, applying Sepsis-3 criteria.

First, is there a suspected or confirmed infection?

Well, the patient had a history of COVID-19 in October, recovered, and was vaccinated in November and December.

He presented with symptoms after the second vaccine dose, but SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative, though IgG was positive.

Throat swab for group A strep was negative, sputum culture showed mixed flora, blood cultures were negative.

All other cultures and workup were negative for infection.

So, is there a confirmed or suspected infection driving his current condition?

It seems that the infectious workup is negative, and the clinical team considered MIS-A, which is a post-infectious inflammatory condition, not an active infection.

So, while there is a history of COVID-19, currently, there doesn't seem to be an active infection driving his symptoms.

Therefore, the first criterion for sepsis—suspected or confirmed infection—may not be met.

But wait, MIS-A is thought to be triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if there's no active infection at presentation.

So, perhaps there's a argument to be made that it's a complication of the infection, but in Sepsis-3, it's about the current presence of infection.

Given that all infectious workup is negative, it's hard to say there's a current infection.

Therefore, perhaps sepsis is not the appropriate diagnosis here.

Moreover, the treatment response to steroids suggests an inflammatory etiology rather than an infectious one.

So, based on the Sepsis-3 criteria, since there's no current infection, sepsis would not be applicable.

Therefore, the answer is 0.

You are an expert physician.  Determine if the patient described in the following case report has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities.
If the information is not present, use your best judgment based on the information available.
Reply 1 for sepsis, 0 otherwise. Reply with the number 0 or 1 only in the \boxed{\n TEXT HERE \n} with no explanation. Here is the case:
Background

Vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are considered the most promising approach for controlling the pandemic. While safety of many of these vaccines has been projected from phase I and II studies, monitoring of authorised vaccines is continuing to track problems or side effects that were not detected during the clinical trials. If there are problems with the vaccines, they are most likely to emerge early in the testing process when they can be identified and addressed. Systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia and arthralgia, can occur following COVID-19 vaccination; however, most systemic postvaccination signs and symptoms are mild to moderate in severity, occur within the first 3 days of vaccination and resolve within 1–2 days of onset.1

BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) is an inactivated vaccine based on a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a patient in China; it has an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant.2 This vaccine has been licensed in the United Arab Emirates based on interim data from a phase III efficacy data that showed the vaccine to have 99% seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody and 100% effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of the disease. Furthermore, the analysis showed no serious safety concerns.3

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection has been defined in children (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C) and adolescents. There have been recent reports of cases with a similar syndrome in adults (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, MIS-A) identified in the USA and the UK, since June 2020. According to these reports, the syndrome appears to be potentially more complicated in adults than in children.4

In this case report, we shall present an entity of adult multisystem inflammatory syndrome that occurred following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in an individual with a recent history of mild COVID-19.

Case presentation

A previously healthy 22-year-old man presented to our emergency department in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in December. This patient was diagnosed with mild COVID-19 illness, sore throat and loss of sense of smell as well as positive COVID-19 PCR, 0n 26 October 2020. Following full recovery by resolution of symptoms and reverting to negative PCR, he received the first dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on November 6. Following the first dose of vaccine, he remained asymptomatic and well. He received the second dose on 6 December 2020. A few hours later the patient started to experience headache and fatigue. The day after, he started to develop fever, sore throat and abdominal pain. The illness progressed over the following 4 days when he presented to the emergency department with high-grade fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, and a faint erythematous non-itchy rash over his torso that he noticed earlier that day. The patient reported a dry irritant cough but no shortness of breath or chest discomfort. He had no urinary symptoms and no pain or swelling of his joints.

The patient had no history of recent travel, no sick contacts, no animal exposure and no consumption of raw dairy products. He was not on any chronic medications and had no known allergies. He reported taking ibuprofen and one dose of an antibiotic over the prior few days for symptomatic relief. He was a non-smoker and did not use recreational drugs.

In the emergency department the patient was noted to have a temperature of 39°C, systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg and tachycardia, 140 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes with congested throat. Bilateral conjunctival injection and left conjunctival haemorrhage. There was a generalised erythematous maculopapular rash, mostly over the chest and back. His peripheral lymph nodes were not enlarged. There were no audible cardiac murmurs, his chest was clear to auscultation, abdomen examination was unremarkable.

Investigations

Laboratory investigations on presentation are outlined in table 1. SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was negative, however SARS-CoV-2 IgG from serum using Liaison XL SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG reagent was later found to be strongly positive at 345 AU/mL (more than 15 AU/mL: positive result). Throat swab was negative for group A streptococcus, sputum culture showed mixed flora and bacterial blood cultures were negative. Urinalysis showed significant proteinuria of more than 300 µg. ANA, dsDNA, c-ANCA and p-ANCA titres were all negative; C3 and C4 were however reduced.

Treatment

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypotension, with diagnosis of probable sepsis versus vaccine-related illness. He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. In addition to intravenous fluids for resuscitation, he was also given intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg two times per day. The hydrocortisone was given for 2 days and subsequently stopped once patient achieved haemodynamic stability.

The patient’s blood pressure stabilised. Fever initially improved but remained persistent throughout his ICU stay. He quickly started to develop facial puffiness and generalised body oedema. He remained tachycardic, diarrhoea persisted, watery occasionally with incontinence. It was difficult for the patient to mobilise without the support of a walking frame as a result of the myalgia and the anasarca.

Further workup revealed evidence of renal impairment with significant proteinuria. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific T-wave abnormalities,
