So I have this case report here about a patient with Listeria monocytogenes infection, and I need to determine if the patient has sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what the Sepsis-3 criteria are. From what I remember, Sepsis-3 defines sepsis as a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The criteria include two main components: suspected or confirmed infection and organ dysfunction.

Organ dysfunction is assessed using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. An increase of two points or more in the SOFA score is indicative of organ dysfunction. Alternatively, in clinical practice, parameters like lactate levels and urine output are often used to assess organ perfusion and function.

In this case report, the patient has a confirmed infection with Listeria monocytogenes, as evidenced by positive blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metagenomic testing. So, the infection criterion is satisfied.

Now, I need to look for signs of organ dysfunction. Let's review the patient's clinical presentation and lab results.

The patient presented with fever, chills, dizziness, and some neurological symptoms like confusion and altered mental status. There are also lab abnormalities such as elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-10), low hemoglobin, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia), and some liver enzyme elevations.

Looking at the CSF analysis, there are elevated nucleated cell counts, increased protein, low glucose, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). These findings suggest meningitis, which is an organ dysfunction of the central nervous system.

Additionally, the patient developed respiratory failure, requiring high-frequency oxygenation and eventually mechanical ventilation. This indicates respiratory organ dysfunction.

There are also mentions of septic shock with blood pressure drops and the need for norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis where there is persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, and there is usually evidence of inadequate tissue perfusion.

Given these findings, it seems that the patient not only has sepsis but has progressed to septic shock, as there is evidence of organ dysfunction (meningitis, respiratory failure) and hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors.

However, I should double-check if all these criteria are clearly met in the case report.

First, confirmed infection: Yes, Listeria monocytogenes identified in blood cultures and CSF metagenomic testing.

Second, organ dysfunction: The patient has meningitis (CNS dysfunction), respiratory failure (respiratory dysfunction), and septic shock (hemodynamic instability).

Therefore, this patient meets the criteria for septic shock.

But to be thorough, let's see if there's any information that might contradict this conclusion.

Looking back at the case report, the patient was initially treated with levofloxacin, then switched to vancomycin, and later to a combination of vancomycin and meropenem. The patient had fluctuations in clinical status, with periods of improvement and deterioration, ultimately leading to multiorgan failure and death.

Given the severity of the illness and the presence of multiple organ dysfunctions, it's clear that this patient had septic shock.

So, to answer the question: Does the patient have sepsis or septic shock based on Sepsis-3 criteria?

The answer is 1 for sepsis, but more specifically, it's septic shock due to the presence of organ dysfunction and hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors.

But since the options are only 0 or 1, and 1 corresponds to sepsis, I need to choose 1, understanding that septic shock is a more severe form of sepsis.

You are an expert physician.  Determine if the patient described in the following case report has either sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Sepsis-3 criteria, which correspond to having a (1) suspected or confirmed infection and (2) blood pressure/respiratory rate/mental status abnormalities.
If the information is not present, use your best judgment based on the information available.
Reply 1 for sepsis, 0 otherwise. Reply with the number 0 or 1 only in the \boxed{\n TEXT HERE \n} with no explanation. Here is the case:
pmc Core Tip: Listeria is a considered a food-borne disease but is rarely prevalent in the normal population. We present herein, a rare case of meningoencephalitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) that evolved in a previously healthy immunocompetent old male patient. Both the cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic test and bilateral blood culture test results suggested the occurrence of L. monocytogenes. The findings of this case highlight the ultimate importance of early identification and timely application of sensitive antibiotics. Therefore, for high-risk populations with unknown causes of fever, multiple blood cultures, timely cerebrospinal fluid examination, and metagenomic detection technology can assist in confirming the diagnosis quickly, which can facilitate the application of suitable antibiotics and significantly improve the prognosis.

INTRODUCTION

Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a gram-positive facultative intracellular bacteria. It can be spread to the humans through the ingestion of contaminated foods, especially ready-to-eat foods, products with a longer shelf life, cooked foods, and soft cheeses[1-3]. It predominantly affects pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients[3-5]. The morbidity rate is estimated to be about 3-6 cases per million per year, and the mortality rate is approximately 27%[6]. The most common forms of infections include listeriosis of the nervous system, bacteremia, and the vertical transmission from the mother to child[2]. Moreover, infections caused during pregnancy can contribute to miscarriage, premature delivery, and amnionitis, while neonatal infections can lead to delayed meningitis, conjunctivitis, and pneumonia. Additionally, in immunodeficiency patients, Listeria can also easily cause central nervous system infection, endocarditis, and sepsis[7]. The clinical symptoms of Listeria meningitis are similar to meningoencephalitis caused by other bacterium, but the prodromal period is relatively long, the repeated detection rate of the traditional tests is low, and the first-line treatment with the third-generation cephalosporins is often ineffective[8]. Therefore, it is especially important to diagnose the disease as early as possible so that an appropriate treatment can be initiated, and the best clinical outcome can be achieved in infected patients, especially immunocompromised elderly patients.

CASE PRESENTATION

Chief complaints

A 75-year-old male was suffering from fever for 1 wk, as a result of which the patient was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases on May the 18th, 2020.

History of present illness

The highest body temperature recorded was 39.0 °C, and it was accompanied by chills, dizziness during the fever, and remission after fever. The patient suffered from no headache, abdominal pain, or diarrhea, and sputum, nasal congestion, or runny nose was not evident.

History of past illness

He had a history of hypertension.

Personal and family history

No special personal or family history was reported.

Physical examination

The patient’s temperature was 39 °C, heart rate was 98 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 139/75 mmHg, and oxygen saturation in room air was 98%. The breath sounds in both the lungs were clear, heart rhythm was uniform, and the neurological tests were negative.

Laboratory examinations

A number of routine blood and biochemical tests were conducted which showed the following values: white blood cell count 7.1 × 109/L, neutrophils 58.6%, monocytes 24.4%, hemoglobin 83 g/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 111.20 mg/L, cell factor interleukin (IL)-6: 279.22 pg/mL↑, cell factor IL-10 3653.30 pg/mL↑, plasma procalcitonin 0.19 ng/mL, blood amyloid A 509.5 mg/L↑, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 71 mm/L, lactate dehydrogenase 694 U/L↑, creatine kinase 19 U/L↓, albumin 27 g/L↓, K+ 2.99 mmol/L↓, Na+ 135.1 mmol/L↓, Cl- 98.5 mmol/L↓, calcium 1.87 mmol/L↓, phosphorus 0.65 mmol/L↓, but creatinine level was found to be normal. The patient’s anti-nuclear antibody, titer 1:100, anti-SSA-, and anti-SCL70 positive. The patient’s TORCH test (Toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalo, and herpes viruses), Plasmodium test, fungal D-glucan test, coronavirus disease 2019, hemorrhagic fever IgM antibody, Widder test, and Weil Felix reaction results were all noted to be normal. Bilateral blood culture test results suggested the occurrence of "L. monocytogenes". To complete the lumbar puncture, the routine result of cerebrospinal fluid was as follows: "nucleated cell count 420 × 106/L (reference range is less than 8 × 106/L), lymphocyte 75%", cerebrospinal fluid biochemical "lactate dehydrogenase 472 U/L" (Reference range 8-32 U/L), total protein 261.3 mg/dL (reference range 15.0-45.0 mg/dL), glucose 1.51 mmol/L (reference range 2.5-4.5 mmmol/L), chloride content (Cl-) 111.0 mmol/l (reference range 120.0-130.0 mmol/L)", cerebrospinal fluid adenosine deaminase 16 U/L (normal), cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal smear and cryptococcal capsular antigen test were all found to be negative, but the cerebrospinal fluid culture was observed to be negative. Cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic test results indicated the presence of "G+ bacteria, L. monocytogenes, and the relative abundance was 2.14%". In addition, the suspected background bacteria "G+ bacteria, was Staphylococcus aureus, and the relative abundance was 0.43%" were also detected. The results of CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and PCT during the patient's hospitalization have been shown in Figure 1.

Imaging examinations

The chest computed tomography (CT) results of the patient revealed a small amount of effusion in the pleural cavities on both the sides, and nodules were distinctly visible in the pleura and under the pleura (Figure 2A and B). However, no obvious abnormalities were found in cranial computed tomography. After two weeks treatment, CT of the patient’s chest displayed multiple nodules in both lungs (similar to the previous), scattered patchy shadows in both the lungs, and possible infection; in addition, the patient had a small amount of pleural effusion (found to be decreased) in both lungs (Figure 2C-E). The results of cranial MR plain scan + water suppression + diffusion-weighted diffusion weighted imaging showed that abnormal signals were scattered in the sub-frontal cortex, midbrain, and posterior horns of both the sides of the ventricle, whereas the lacunar foci were found to be scattered under the frontal cortex on both the sides, and transparent interstitial space was formed (Figure 3).

As shown by the arrows, a small amount of pleural effusion can be seen in both the lungs, and scattered nodules can be observed in the pleura and under the pleura; C-E: The results of chest CT upon two weeks later. The new appearances of the two lungs were mostly scattered in the patchy high-density shadows, with distinctly blurred boundaries, distributed along with the bronchial vascular bundle, mainly under the pleura.

DIAGNOSIS

The patient's diagnosis was finally considered to be sepsis, lung infection, respiratory failure, electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypokalemia, autoimmune disease and Listeria monocytic meningoencephalitis.

TREATMENT

The patient was hence administered levofloxacin 0.5 g qd intravenously
