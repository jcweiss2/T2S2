I have a case report here about a 21-year-old male with COVID-19 who developed pulmonary embolism (PE). The case is quite detailed, and I need to determine if this patient had sepsis or septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 criteria. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall the Sepsis-3 criteria. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The criteria include suspected or confirmed infection and the presence of organ dysfunction, which is often assessed using the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or the quick SOFA (qSOFA) score for initial identification.

The qSOFA criteria are:

- Altered mental status

- Systolic blood pressure ≤100 mmHg

- Respiratory rate ≥22 breaths per minute

If a patient meets two or more of these criteria, it suggests the possibility of sepsis, and further assessment with SOFA is recommended.

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis where there's profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with a greater risk of mortality.

Now, let's look at the case report.

The patient presented with symptoms like cough, fevers, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, light-headedness, and near syncope. He was febrile (38.9°C), tachycardic (121 bpm), normotensive initially (104/66 mmHg), but became hypotensive later. He was hypoxic initially but improved with oxygen support.

He was diagnosed with COVID-19 via PCR and had a sub-massive PE on CTPA. He was started on unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Twelve hours into his hospital course, he became hypotensive and was diagnosed with massive PE, leading to CDT of bilateral pulmonary arteries.

On hospital day 4, he developed acute respiratory failure and hypotension, required intubation, and had a cardiac arrest, which was reversed with CPR and defibrillation. He was started on vasopressors and ECMO.

He had recurrent massive PE, underwent repeat CDT, and had other complications like septic shock, a right thigh hematoma with compartment syndrome, and was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Now, to determine if this patient had sepsis or septic shock, I need to see if there was a suspected or confirmed infection and if there were signs of organ dysfunction.

The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, which is a confirmed infection. So, the infection criterion is met.

Next, I need to look for signs of organ dysfunction. The patient had multiple organ dysfunctions:

- Respiratory: hypoxia, need for high-flow oxygen, intubation, ECMO

- Cardiovascular: hypotension, need for vasopressors, cardiac arrest

- Possibly renal or other organs, but the report doesn't specify

Given these, it seems there was significant organ dysfunction.

However, the primary focus of the case is on the pulmonary embolism and its management, including CDT and ECMO. The sepsis aspect seems secondary, but since COVID-19 was present and there were multiple organ dysfunctions, it's reasonable to consider sepsis.

But, to make it clearer, I need to see if the organ dysfunctions were directly attributable to the infection or to the PE.

PE can cause hypoxia and hypotension, which are similar to what's seen in sepsis. In this case, the patient had both COVID-19 and PE, so it's possible that both contributed to the organ dysfunctions.

Given that, it might be challenging to disentangle the contributions of each condition to the organ dysfunctions.

However, according to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. If the infection is present and there's organ dysfunction, it's considered sepsis, even if other factors are contributing.

In this case, since there was a confirmed infection (COVID-19) and significant organ dysfunction, it's appropriate to consider that the patient had sepsis.

Furthermore, the patient had septic shock, as indicated by the need for vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and the presence of acute organ dysfunction.

But, the case report specifically mentions "septic shock treated" on hospital day 11-52. So, at some point, the patient was treated for septic shock.

However, considering the entire clinical course, it seems that the patient had septic shock due to COVID-19, complicated by massive PE requiring CDT and ECMO.

Given that, I would say that the patient had septic shock.

But, to answer the question based on the Sepsis-3 criteria:

- Confirmed infection: Yes (COVID-19)

- Organ dysfunction: Yes (respiratory failure, hypotension, need for vasopressors, ECMO)

Therefore, the patient had septic shock.

So, my answer is 1.

Learning points

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) and should be suspected in any patient with haemodynamic collapse regardless of their age, clinical trajectory, or anticoagulation status.

Careful attention should be paid to initiation and dosing of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. This is particularly true of obese patients.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in critically ill patients with massive PE and COVID-19.

Introduction

Since the emergence of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), an association between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coagulopathy has been noted.1 Pulmonary embolism (PE) is widely described in this context, even among patients at low risk for venous thromboembolic (VTE) events.2 We illustrate the case of a 21-year-old male, who presented with COVID-19 and a sub-massive PE with later development of massive-PE requiring catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and repeat CDT for recurrent massive PE.

Timeline

Hospital day(s)	Significant event	
1–2	Patient presented to the emergency department and was diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) by PCR and acute sub-massive pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA; unfractionated heparin (UFH) was initiated. Twelve hours into hospital course, the patient became hypotensive, was diagnosed with massive PE and underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) of the bilateral pulmonary arteries.	
3	Patient improved clinically; plans made for discharge.	
4	Patient developed acute respiratory failure and hypotension. Patient was intubated and developed cardiac arrest; return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and electrical shock. Vasopressors and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were initiated at bedside. Pulmonary artery angiogram demonstrated interval worsening of bilateral pulmonary emboli compared to index computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, confirming diagnosis of recurrent massive PE. Repeat CDT was performed.	
5–9	Ventilation parameters improved, vasopressors were discontinued, and weaning of ECMO began. Venous duplex ultrasound demonstrated deep venous thrombus of the right femoral vein and right popliteal vein. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. UFH transitioned to low-molecular weight heparin.	
10	Repeat pulmonary artery angiogram demonstrated improvement in emboli burden. Patient successfully weaned from ECMO and decannulated.	
11–52	Hospital course was notable for septic shock treated and development of a right thigh haematoma with compartment syndrome requiring surgical debridement on hospital Day 40. Post-operatively, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban. On hospital Day 52, the patient was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility.	

Case presentation

An obese 21-year-old male with no other past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with 3 days of cough, fevers, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and 1 day of light-headedness with near syncope as well as acutely worsened dyspnoea. He denied contact with sick persons, exertional chest pain, weight loss, night sweats, abdominal pain, changes in bladder or bowel habits, and recent travel, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Upon arrival, he was febrile (38.9°C), tachycardic (121 beats per minute), normotensive (104/66 mmHg), and hypoxic saturating 82% on room air, however, improved to 100% with non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min.

Obesity: body mass index (BMI) 37.

This patient’s presentation with chest pain, dyspnoea, and near syncope preceded by cough and fever in the midst of a global pandemic raised concerns for COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia as well as pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated evidence of right heart strain as well as S wave in lead I, Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3), a pattern associated with acute PE (Figure 1). Point of care ultrasound demonstrated right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with preserved apical contractility (McConnel’s sign), also consistent with PE. Initial D-Dimer was elevated at 3.71 mcg/mL (Ref. range ≤0.49), troponin-T was elevated at 0.04 ng/mL (Ref. range ≤0.00), and pro-BNP NT was elevated at 4573 pg/mL (Ref. range ≤125). A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) demonstrated pulmonary emboli involving the bilateral pulmonary arteries, including the central, segmental, and subsegmental branches. There was also enlargement of the pulmonary trunk and flattening of the interventricular septum, with right ventricle to left ventricle ratio of 1.4 to 1 (Figure 2).

(B) CTPA demonstrating flattening of the interventricular septum and increased right ventricle:left ventricle ratio, suggestive of right ventricular strain in the setting of pulmonary embolism.

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) on high-flow nasal cannula and intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusion (goal PTT 60–80 s) with stable vital signs. Twelve hours after initial presentation, the patient became increasingly hypoxic and persistently hypotensive with systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg. At this point, he was presumptively diagnosed with massive PE, and urgently underwent CDT of the bilateral pulmonary arteries utilizing the EKOS™ Endowave Infusion Catheter System (1 mg/h tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) per side over 6 h). Intravenous heparin infusion was continued (goal PTT 40–60 s during tPA infusion, 60–80 s post-tPA infusion). Following CDT, the patient improved clinically and was transferred to the general medicine floor on hospital Day 3 with minimal supplemental oxygen and plan to discharge with oral anticoagulation.

On hospital Day 4, the patient was initially normotensive with blood pressure 114/64 mmHg and saturating 99% on 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal cannular when he developed acute respiratory failure with oxygen saturation of 65% requiring non-re-breather mask and hypotension with blood pressure 70/30 mmHg. The patient was subsequently intubated and developed cardiac arrest regaining spontaneous circulation after two rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and one electrical shock. Vasopressor support was initiated with norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine. Due to persistent haemodynamic instability, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated at bedside. Recurrence of massive PE was suspected, but a repeat CTPA could not be obtained due to clinical instability. Instead, the patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory where a pulmonary angiogram demonstrated
