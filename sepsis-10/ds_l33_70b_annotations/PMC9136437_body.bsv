Okay, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is timestamp 0. If an event doesn't have a timestamp, I should use 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and events after have positive. I need to convert time into hours. If the time isn't specified, I should estimate based on context.

First, I'll read through the case report to identify all the events. The patient is a 59-year-old female with a liver transplant. She had a segment-V lesion suspected to be liver cancer. Let me note down each event as I go.

She had a transarterial embolization on August 29, 2018. That's before the transplant, so I need to calculate how many hours before October 13, 2019. Wait, the transplant was on October 13, 2019. So from August 29, 2018, to October 13, 2019, that's more than a year. Let me calculate the days: August 29 to August 29, 2019, is exactly one year, which is 365 days. Then from August 29 to October 13 is 45 days (August has 31, so 3 days in August, September 30, October 13 is 13, so 3+30+13=46 days). So total is 365 + 46 = 411 days. Convert to hours: 411 * 24 = 9864 hours. Since it's before admission, it's -9864.

She started sorafenib in October 2018. That's after the embolization but before the transplant. October 2018 to October 13, 2019, is almost a year. Let's say approximately 12 months, so 365 days, which is 8760 hours. But she stopped in July 2019 due to symptoms. So sorafenib was from October 2018 to July 2019, which is 9 months. 9*30 days = 270 days, so 6480 hours before admission. So -6480 for starting, and -168 hours (7 days) for stopping? Wait, no, the stopping is an event too. So starting sorafenib: October 2018, about -365*24= -8760? Wait, but she started in October 2018, and the transplant was in October 2019. So it's exactly one year, so -8760 hours. Stopped in July 2019, which is 3 months before October, so 90 days, 2160 hours before admission, so -2160.

Then, a CT scan in September 2019 showed lesion enlargement. That's one month before transplant, so 30 days, 720 hours before, so -720.

Radiation therapy on September 29, 2019. That's 13 October minus 29 September. September has 30 days, so from 29 Sept to 13 Oct is 14 days, which is 336 hours before admission, so -336.

Piggyback LT on October 13, 2019. That's the admission, timestamp 0.

She had a history of hepatitis B, treated with entecavir once. That's part of her history, so timestamp 0.

Transplantation process was smooth, but afterward, she developed acute renal failure and hematoma around the liver. These are post-operative complications, so after admission. The exact time isn't specified, but typically, acute renal failure and hematoma would be noticed shortly after surgery, maybe within the first day. So I'll estimate +24 hours.

Received hepatitis B immunoglobulin and immunosuppressives on POD-1, which is 24 hours after admission, so +24.

After that, she had hemodialysis and blood products, which helped with bleeding and renal recovery. These are treatments, so I'll assign the start time as +24, but since the exact duration isn't given, I'll just note the event at +24.

Pathological analysis confirmed HCC with massive necrosis. This would be after the transplant, so maybe a few days later. Let's say +72 hours.

On POD-10, liver function began to improve. That's 10 days after, so 240 hours, +240.

However, she developed fevers starting around POD-10 as well, peaking daily. So fever starts at +240.

Her PCT levels rose on POD-10, so +240, then dropped on POD-13, which is +312 hours.

On POD-13, blood cultures were negative, and viruses were negative, but fever didn't subside. So these are events at +312.

Rash appeared on POD-13 as obscure red spots on the chest. So rash starts at +312.

No itching, Nikolsky sign negative on POD-13, so those are negative findings, also at +312.

On POD-17, they changed to sirolimus and added mycophenolate. That's 17 days after, 17*24=408 hours, +408.

On POD-18, sputum culture showed infections, so +432.

On POD-19, rash advanced, spread, and oral ulcers appeared. So +456.

Severe bone marrow suppression noted on POD-19, +456.

Transferred to ICU on POD-19, same timestamp.

Dermatologist recommended gamma globulin on POD-19, +456.

Skin biopsy and FISH done on POD-19, +456.

On POD-29, abdominal incision split, +696 hours.

POD-32, bone marrow aspiration, +768.

POD-33, FISH showed 3% donor lymphocytes, +792.

Skin biopsy consistent with grade-1 GVHD on POD-33, +792.

POD-33, lab results showed low immunoglobulins, +792.

PLT dropped to 3.2 on POD-33, same time.

Then, on POD-47, temperature spiked to 39.4Â°C and hallucinations, +47*24=1128.

She succumbed on POD-55, which is +55*24=1320.

I think I've covered all the events. Now, I'll list each event with their timestamps, making sure to separate conjunctive phrases and include all events, even negatives.

Each row represents a clinical event and its corresponding timestamp in hours relative to the admission event (timestamp 0). Events before admission have negative timestamps, and events after have positive timestamps.
