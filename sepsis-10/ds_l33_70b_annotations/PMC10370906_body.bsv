Okay, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive. If an event's time isn't specified, I should use context or clinical judgment to estimate.

First, I'll read through the case presentation to identify all events.

The patient is a 60-year-old female with impaired consciousness. Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, and she's on warfarin after a biventricular pacing ICD implantation.

In the history of present illness, she was found at home and brought to the hospital. On arrival, her JCS was II-10 and GCS 14. No neurological deficits were noted. Non-contrast head CT showed hemorrhage in the third, fourth, and bilateral lateral ventricles, left dominant. The hemorrhage was confined to the ventricles.

A brain 3D-CTA was done. In the arterial phase, the bleeding source was unclear, but in the venous phase, spot enhancement suggested the source in the left lateral ventricle's anterior horn.

After admission, no progression of impaired consciousness, so no ventricular drainage. Blood pressure control in ICU.

On the third day of admission, cerebral angiography showed a 3.8mm aneurysm at the distal mLSA from the left ACA's A1 segment. Embolization with NBCA was performed.

Post-op CT showed no hemorrhagic complications or infarction. She developed sepsis from pneumonia and muscle weakness from disuse. After 6 months of rehab, she was discharged with mRS 1.

Now, I'll list the events with timestamps.

1. Admission: timestamp 0.
2. Impaired consciousness: at admission, so 0.
3. JCS II-10 and GCS 14: at admission, 0.
4. No neurological deficits: 0.
5. Head CT showing ventricular hemorrhage: 0.
6. Brain 3D-CTA showing spot enhancement: 0, since it's part of initial assessment.
7. Blood pressure control in ICU: 0, as it's post-admission but no specific time given.
8. Cerebral angiography on third day: 3 days after admission is 72 hours, so +72.
9. Aneurysm found: same as angiography, +72.
10. Embolization with NBCA: same day as angiography, +72.
11. Post-op CT: after embolization, maybe a few hours later, but no specific time. Since it's after the procedure, I'll estimate +72 or maybe +75, but without exact time, I'll use +72.
12. Sepsis from pneumonia: developed after treatment, but no specific time. Maybe a week later? Let's say +168 (7 days).
13. Muscle weakness from disuse: same as sepsis, +168.
14. Discharge after 6 months: 6 months is 180 days, which is 4320 hours. So +4320.

Wait, but the case says she was discharged after 6 months of rehabilitation. So the discharge event is at +4320.

Now, I need to make sure I didn't miss any events. Also, the patient's past medical history events are before admission.

Her past medical history: atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, warfarin, and ICD implantation. These are all before admission, so their timestamps are negative. But the case doesn't specify when these occurred, so I'll assign them to 0 as per instructions if the event is not available.

Wait, no. The instruction says if the event is not available, treat it as timestamp 0. So her past medical history events should have timestamp 0.

Wait, no. The admission is timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps. But her past medical history is before admission, so they should have negative timestamps. However, the case doesn't specify when these occurred. So according to the instructions, if the time isn't available, use 0. So I'll assign them 0.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. For example, the ICD implantation happened before admission, but without a specific time, we treat it as 0. So all her past medical history events are at 0.

Similarly, the initial symptoms: she was found at home, which led to admission. The time from onset to admission isn't specified, so we treat those events as 0.

Wait, but in the case, it says she was found lying at home and transported to the hospital. The time from onset to arrival isn't given, so we can't assign a negative timestamp. So all these events are at 0.

Wait, but in the example provided, the user treated the 3-day history of fever and rash as -72 hours. So in this case, the onset of impaired consciousness and transport to the hospital would be at 0, as we don't have the duration.

Wait, no. The example had a 3-day history, so it was clear. Here, the case doesn't specify how long before admission the impaired consciousness started. So we can't assign a negative timestamp. Therefore, all events at admission are 0.

So compiling all events:

- 60 years old | 0
- female | 0
- impaired consciousness | 0
- JCS II-10 | 0
- GCS 14 | 0
- no neurological deficits | 0
- head CT showing hemorrhage | 0
- brain 3D-CTA spot enhancement | 0
- blood pressure control | 0
- cerebral angiography | +72
- aneurysm found | +72
- embolization with NBCA | +72
- post-op CT | +72
- sepsis | +168
- muscle weakness | +168
- discharge | +4320

Wait, but the case mentions that after embolization, she developed sepsis and muscle weakness, but doesn't specify the exact time. So I estimated sepsis at +168 (1 week) and discharge at +4320 (6 months). That seems reasonable.

I think that's all the events. Now, I'll format them as per the instructions, each event and timestamp separated by a pipe, no headers, and enclosed in a box.
