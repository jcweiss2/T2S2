Okay, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is at timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive. If the time isn't specified, I should use context or my knowledge to estimate.

First, I'll read through the case presentation to identify all events and their timings.

The patient is a 46-year-old man with ulcerative colitis. He had malaise, fever, and loss of appetite 3 days before admission. That's 72 hours before admission, so timestamp -72.

On arrival, his vital signs were recorded: BP 124/46, HR 122, SpO2 98%, RR 16, temp 40.2°C. These are all at admission, so timestamp 0.

He was lying in bed due to chills and nausea. That's at admission, so 0.

Suddenly, he developed cardiac arrest. Since it happened on arrival, timestamp 0. They did chest compressions and intubation, ECG showed VF. Defibrillation twice and adrenaline once. All these events are at 0.

After resuscitation, diagnosed with BS because ECG showed coved-type ST elevation in V1 and V2. That's at admission, so 0. The ECG improvement after fever subsided with acetaminophen is also at 0 because it's part of the admission events.

He had HC level 14.8 mg/dL at the same time as admission, so 0.

After admission to ICU, he developed hypotension. That's after admission, so timestamp +24 (assuming it's the same day, maybe a few hours later, but not specified, so I'll estimate +24).

They suspected septic shock from UC exacerbation. CT showed high-density area in colon, blood tests showed high lactate, WBC, procalcitonin. All these are after admission, so +24.

Initiated tazobactam-piperacillin and vasopressors. Also +24.

On day 2, extubation performed because stable. Day 2 is 48 hours after admission, so +48.

On day 5, fever reoccurred. That's 5 days after admission, so +120 hours.

CT scan showed liver abscess. Same day as fever, so +120.

Changed antibiotics to meropenem and vancomycin, continued for 3 weeks. So the change is at +120, and the duration is 3 weeks, but the event is the start, so +120.

Performed puncture drainage. Same day, +120.

After infection controlled, on day 30, cardiologist confirmed positive pilsicainide test and ICD implantation. Day 30 is +720 hours.

Discharged after that, so discharge is at +720.

Family history: uncle had sudden death. This is a historical fact, so timestamp 0.

Endocrinologist examined causes of HC. Found high PTH, Tc scintigraphy showed anterior mediastinum uptake. These are during the hospital stay, but exact time not given. Maybe around the time of HC diagnosis, which was at admission, but more likely after some tests, so perhaps +24 or later. But without specifics, I'll assign 0.

After discharge, tumor resection performed. This is after discharge, so after +720, but exact time not given. Maybe +744 (assuming a few days post-discharge, but not sure. Alternatively, since it's after discharge, I can assign +720 + some hours, but without info, maybe just +720.

ECG and serum calcium followed up. Ongoing after discharge, so +720.

Pathological diagnosis: ectopic parathyroid adenoma. This is after surgery, which was after discharge, so +720.

CT and MRI showed pituitary and adrenal tumors. These are likely found during initial workup, maybe around +24 or later. But without specifics, I'll assign 0.

Diagnosed with MEN1. This is a conclusion, so likely at the end of the hospital stay or after all tests, so maybe +720.

Now, I'll list all events with their timestamps:

- 46 years old | 0
- male | 0
- ulcerative colitis | 0 (since it's a known condition)
- admitted to hospital | 0
- malaise | -72
- fever | -72
- loss of appetite | -72
- BP 124/46 | 0
- HR 122 | 0
- SpO2 98% | 0
- RR 16 | 0
- body temperature 40.2°C | 0
- alert | 0
- chills | 0
- nausea | 0
- cardiac arrest | 0
- chest compression | 0
- tracheal intubation | 0
- ECG showed VF | 0
- defibrillation | 0
- adrenaline administered | 0
- diagnosed with BS | 0
- ECG coved-type ST elevation | 0
- HC level 14.8 | 0
- hypotension | +24
- suspected septic shock | +24
- CT high-density in colon | +24
- lactate increased | +24
- WBC increased | +24
- procalcitonin increased | +24
- tazobactam-piperacillin initiated | +24
- vasopressors initiated | +24
- extubation | +48
- fever reoccurred | +120
- CT showed liver abscess | +120
- antibiotics changed | +120
- meropenem | +120
- vancomycin | +120
- puncture drainage | +120
- infection controlled | +720 (assuming 3 weeks is 21 days, but day 30 is +720, so maybe after)
- positive pilsicainide test | +720
- ICD implantation | +720
- discharged | +720
- family history sudden death | 0
- high PTH | 0
- Tc scintigraphy abnormal | 0
- tumor resection | +720
- ECG follow-up | +720
- serum calcium follow-up | +720
- ectopic parathyroid adenoma | +720
- pituitary adenomas | 0
- adrenal tumors | 0
- MEN1 diagnosed | +720

I think that's all the events. Now, I'll format them as per the instructions, each event and timestamp separated by a pipe, no headers, each in a row.
