Okay, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive. If the time isn't specified, I should use context or my knowledge to estimate. I'll go through the case step by step.

First, the patient is a 46-year-old woman. That's a demographic event, so timestamp 0. She decided to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. That's the reason for admission, so also timestamp 0.

Her past medical history includes obesity, psoriatic arthritis treated with immunosuppressants, surgical hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism after a thyroidectomy 20 years ago. These are all historical, so I need to calculate their timestamps. Since the thyroidectomy was 20 years ago, that's way before admission. But the case doesn't specify exact timing relative to admission, so I might treat these as timestamp 0 since they're part of her history at admission.

She had no history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or sleep apnea. These are negative findings, so they should be included with timestamp 0.

She was well-managed on oral calcium carbonate and calcitriol before surgery. This is part of her history, so timestamp 0.

In November 2018, she had a planned sleeve gastrectomy converted to Roux-en-Y due to gastric perforations. The exact date isn't given relative to admission, but since this is the surgery leading to admission, I think the surgery is the admission event, so timestamp 0.

Post-operatively, she developed abdominal sepsis and was transferred to ICU 4 days later. Transfer to ICU is 4 days after surgery, so timestamp +96 hours.

Upon arrival at the tertiary hospital, she was nil orally, calcium was critically low (0.78 mmol/L), but asymptomatic. This is on admission to the tertiary hospital, which is after the initial admission, so timestamp +96 hours.

She required IV calcium gluconate infusion and intermittent boluses. This starts at ICU admission, so +96 hours.

Her ICU stay was 6 months, which is 4320 hours. She had over 20 abdominal operations during this time. These are ongoing events, but the exact timing isn't specified, so I might assign the start as +96 and note the duration, but since the output requires a single timestamp, perhaps the start time.

She lost 14 kg during this period. Again, this is a duration, so maybe assign the timestamp as the start, +96.

Endocrinology was involved throughout admission, managing hypoparathyroidism and hypothyroidism parenterally. This starts at admission, so timestamp 0, but since it's mentioned during ICU, maybe +96.

Two weeks into admission, endocrinology advised on hypothyroidism management. Two weeks is 336 hours, so timestamp +336.

Her TSH was 5.83 mU/L, which is a lab result, so timestamp +336.

IV T3 was started at 10 µg BD, then titrated to 40/20/40 µg daily. Start at +336.

Euthyroidism was achieved, but no specific time given, so maybe +336.

High-dose IV calcium was required, 4.4 mmol five times daily. This is part of her treatment, starting at +96.

Ionised calcium measured daily via blood gases. Ongoing, so start at +96.

Serum phosphate was normal at 1.07 mmol/L. This is a lab result, likely at ICU admission, so +96.

IV calcitriol 1 µg alternate daily was started 6 weeks into admission. Six weeks is 1008 hours, so timestamp +1008.

It was ceased 5 days later due to stock issues. So cessation is at +1008 + 120 = +1128.

At 8 weeks (1344 hours), IM cholecalciferol 150,000 units was trialled. Timestamp +1344.

The 1,25(OH)vitamin D level was 31 pmol/L before and 29 after, so these are lab results at +1344 and +1344 + 3*24=+168 hours later, but since the exact time after isn't specified, maybe just +1344 for both.

Renal function was normal (eGFR >90), so timestamp +96 as it's part of initial assessment.

Three months into admission (2160 hours), IV calcitriol was recommenced. Timestamp +2160.

This reduced calcium gluconate to 3 times daily. So the reduction event is at +2160.

IM thyroxine 600 µg was trialled but found painful. Timestamp +2160.

IV thyroxine 200 µg alternate daily started 4 days later, so +2160 + 96 = +2256.

A maintenance schedule was established, but no specific time, so maybe +2256.

She was discharged after over 8 months (30 May 2019). The exact discharge date is given, but since admission was in November 2018, 8 months is about 240*8=1920 hours, but more precisely, from 07/11/18 to 30/5/19 is about 8.5 months, roughly 2040 hours. But discharge is an event after, so timestamp +2040.

At discharge, she recommenced oral calcitriol 0.75 µg daily and increased calcium to 1200 mg twice daily. Timestamp +2040.

Follow-ups at 6 weeks (+2040 + 168 = +2208), 12 weeks (+2208 + 168 = +2376), and 4 months (+2376 + 168 = +2544) showed normocalcaemia.

She weighed 71.8 kg and BMI 29 at 4-month follow-up. Timestamp +2544.

Now, compiling all these events with their timestamps.
