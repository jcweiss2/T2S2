Okay, so I need to extract clinical events and their timestamps from this case report. The admission event is at timestamp 0. Events before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive. If an event doesn't have a specific time, I should use context or knowledge to estimate. I also need to separate conjunctive phrases into individual events and include all events, even if they seem minor or negative.

First, I'll read through the case report carefully to identify all the events and their timings.

The patient is a neonate, so the timeline starts from birth. He was delivered by emergency C-section at 31 weeks due to abruptio placenta. That's the starting point, but since admission is timestamp 0, I need to see when events occur relative to that.

Looking at the case report, the infant was admitted to the NICU, which is our timestamp 0. Events before that, like the delivery, would have negative timestamps. Let's break it down.

1. **Delivery and Initial Events:**
   - Delivered at 31 weeks via emergency C-section. This is before admission, so it's a negative timestamp. How many hours before? Assuming admission is at birth, delivery is at time 0, but since the report says he was admitted after delivery, maybe delivery is at -1 hour or something. But the exact time isn't given, so I might need to approximate. Alternatively, since the delivery is the event leading to admission, perhaps it's considered part of the admission event at 0. But the problem says admission is 0, so delivery is before that. Maybe -12 hours? Not sure, but perhaps it's better to assign it as -1 hour if exact time isn't given.

2. **Resuscitation and NICU Admission:**
   - After delivery, he was in mild respiratory distress, put on CPAP. This is at admission, so timestamp 0.

3. **Physical Exam Findings:**
   - Cloudy eyes, ectropion, dry ichthyotic skin, undescended testicles. These are noted on admission, so 0.

4. **Lab Results on Admission:**
   - Blood count, electrolytes, liver function were normal. Timestamp 0.

5. **Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome:**
   - Diagnosed on admission, so 0.

6. **Treatment with Surfactant:**
   - Given at admission, so 0.

7. **Bowel Movement at 12 Hours Old:**
   - 12 hours after birth, which would be 12 hours after admission (timestamp +12).

8. **Trophic Feeding Started on Day 3:**
   - Day 3 is 72 hours after admission, so +72.

9. **Weaned from CPAP to High-Flow Oxygen in Second Week:**
   - Second week is around 14 days, so 14*24=336 hours, timestamp +336.

10. **Abdominal Distension, Tachycardia, etc., on Day 6:**
    - Day 6 is 6*24=144 hours after admission, so +144.

11. **Antibiotics Escalated to Meropenem and Vancomycin:**
    - Same as above, +144.

12. **Stopped Trophic Feeding Due to Abdominal Distension:**
    - +144.

13. **Restarted Feeding at 30 mL/kg/day After 72 Hours:**
    - 72 hours after stopping, which would be 72 hours after +144, so +144+72=216.

14. **Relapses of Apnea in Weeks 3 and 4:**
    - Week 3 is +168, Week 4 is +336. So two events at +168 and +336.

15. **MRI and Other Tests:**
    - MRI was normal, timestamp not specified. Since it's part of the diagnostic workup after admission, maybe around +72 to +168.

16. **Cholestasis Workup Started in Third Week:**
    - Third week is +504 hours (21 days). So +504.

17. **Whole-Exome Sequencing at 8 Weeks:**
    - 8 weeks is 56 days, so 56*24=1344 hours, timestamp +1344.

18. **Worsening Cholestasis and Treatment:**
    - Ursodeoxycholic acid started, but exact time not given. Maybe around +504.

19. **Genetic Diagnosis After Death:**
    - The patient died after 100 days, which is 2400 hours. The diagnosis was made a week after death, so +2400 + 168=2568.

20. **Pathological Findings and Genetic Results:**
    - These are post-mortem, so after 2400 hours.

I think I need to list all these events with their timestamps, making sure to separate any conjunctive phrases. For example, "fever and rash" become two separate events.

Wait, in the provided example, the user had "fever" and "rash" as separate events. So I need to do the same here.

Let me list all events I can find:

- Emergency C-section delivery
- Admission to NICU
- Mild respiratory distress
- CPAP with 6 PEEP and 30% FiO2
- Cloudy eyes
- Ectropion
- Dry ichthyotic skin
- Undescended testicles
- Normal blood count, electrolytes, liver function
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis
- Surfactant administration
- Bowel movement at 12h
- Trophic feeding started day 3
- Weaned to high-flow oxygen second week
- Abdominal distension day 6
- Tachycardia day 6
- Tachypnea day 6
- Thrombocytopenia day 6
- Neutropenia day 6
- Raised CRP day 6
- Antibiotics escalated day 6
- Stopped trophic feeding day 6
- Restarted feeding after 72h
- Relapse of apnea week 3
- Relapse of apnea week 4
- Negative septic workups each time
- Normal brain MRI
- Nasogastric tube for feeding
- No pale stools
- Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia since week 3
- Negative septic workups
- Genetic studies initiated
- Normal spine X-ray
- Normal echocardiogram
- Normal eye exam
- Craniosynostosis on skull X-ray
- Albumin infusions
- Rising bilirubin, AST, ALT
- Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment
- Unremarkable infectious workup
- Normal TSH, T3, T4, cortisol
- Negative metabolic disorders
- Whole-exome sequencing at 8 weeks
- Recurrent apnea managed with CPAP
- Septic exams negative
- Died after 100 days
- Genetic diagnosis post-mortem
- Pathogenic variant in NOTCH2 gene
- Craniosynostosis finding

Now, assigning timestamps:

- Delivery: Let's say it's just before admission, so maybe -1 hour, but since exact time isn't given, perhaps it's better to assign 0 as admission, and delivery is part of that event. Alternatively, if delivery is before admission, it's -1 hour.

But the problem says admission is 0, so delivery is before that. If the delivery was immediately before admission, maybe -1 hour. But without exact time, perhaps it's better to assign 0 to admission, and delivery is part of that.

Wait, the example given in the problem had the admission event at 0, and events before that had negative timestamps. So delivery is before admission, so it's negative. But how much before? The case report doesn't specify the exact time between delivery and admission. Maybe it's negligible, so we can assign delivery as 0 as well, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the delivery is considered part of the admission event, so 0.

I think for the purpose of this exercise, I'll assign delivery and admission as 0, since the exact time difference isn't provided.

So:

- Emergency C-section delivery: 0
- Admission to NICU: 0
- Mild respiratory distress: 0
- CPAP with 6 PEEP and 30% FiO2: 0
- Cloudy eyes: 0
- Ectropion: 0
- Dry ichthyotic skin: 0
- Undescended testicles: 0
- Normal blood count, electrolytes, liver function: 0
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis: 0
- Surfactant administration: 0
- Bowel movement: +12
- Trophic feeding started: +72
- Weaned to high-flow oxygen: +336
- Abdominal distension: +144
- Tachycardia: +144
- Tachypnea: +144
- Thrombocytopenia: +144
- Neutropenia: +144
- Raised CRP: +144
- Antibiotics escalated: +144
- Stopped trophic feeding: +144
- Restarted feeding: +216
- Relapse of apnea week 3: +168
- Relapse of apnea week 4: +336
- Negative septic workups: +168 and +336
- Normal brain MRI: Let's say around +72
- Nasogastric tube: Ongoing, but started around +72
- No pale stools: Noted on exam, maybe +72
- Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: Noted in week 3, so +504
- Negative septic workups: +504
- Genetic studies initiated: +504
- Normal spine X-ray: +504
- Normal echocardiogram: +504
- Normal eye exam: +504
- Craniosynostosis on skull X-ray: +504
- Albumin infusions: Ongoing, started around +504
- Rising bilirubin, AST, ALT: Ongoing, noted around +504
- Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment: Started around +504
- Unremarkable infectious workup: +504
- Normal TSH, T3, T4, cortisol: +504
- Negative metabolic disorders: +504
- Whole-exome sequencing: +1344
- Recurrent apnea managed with CPAP: +168 and +336
- Septic exams negative: +168 and +336
- Died after 100 days: 100 days = 2400 hours
- Genetic diagnosis post-mortem: +2400 + 168 = +2568
- Pathogenic variant in NOTCH2 gene: +2568
- Craniosynostosis finding: +504

Wait, but the craniosynostosis was found on skull X-ray at 4 weeks, which is +672 hours (4 weeks * 24*7=672). So that should be +672, not +504.

Similarly, the genetic studies were initiated at 8 weeks, which is +1344.

So adjusting:

- Craniosynostosis on skull X-ray: +672
- Genetic studies initiated: +1344
- Whole-exome sequencing: +1344
- Genetic diagnosis: +2568

Also, the patient died after 100 days, which is 2400 hours, so discharge/death event at +2400.

I think I need to structure each event with its timestamp, ensuring that all are included, even if some are negative or zero.

Now, compiling all events with their timestamps:

1. Emergency C-section delivery | 0
