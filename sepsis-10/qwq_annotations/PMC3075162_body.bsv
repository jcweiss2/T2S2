Human: I have a case report, and I need to extract the clinical events and their related time stamps. The admission event has a timestamp of 0. If an event is not available, we treat it as having a timestamp of 0. Events that occurred before admission have negative timestamps, and those after have positive timestamps. The timestamps are in hours, but the unit is omitted in the output. If there's no temporal information for an event, I should use my knowledge and the context to approximate the timestamp. The goal is to predict future events based on past events.

Here's the case report:

An 18-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of fever and rash. Four weeks ago, he was diagnosed with acne and received treatment with minocycline, 100 mg daily, for 3 weeks. With increased WBC count, eosinophilia, and systemic involvement, this patient was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome. The fever and rash persisted through admission, and diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus was present. One day later, the patient was discharged.

I need to list all the events with their timestamps in a table format, separated by a pipe ('|'). For example:

18 years old | 0

male | 0

admitted to the hospital | 0

fever | -72

rash | -72

acne | -672

minocycline | -672

increased WBC count | 0

eosinophilia | 0

systemic involvement | 0

diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption | 0

pruritus | 0

DRESS syndrome | 0

fever persisted | 0

rash persisted | 0

discharged | 24

I need to make sure to separate conjunctive phrases into their component events and assign them the same timestamp. If an event has a duration, I should assign the timestamp as the start of the time interval. I should include all patient events, even if they are mentioned in discussions, and include termination or discontinuation events. Also, include pertinent negative findings.

Please provide the table of events and timestamps for this case report.
