pmcDiscussionBS is a rare, fatal genetic arrhythmia without organic disease and is classified into type 1 and 2 according to its characteristic ECG waveform.[1] Patients with prior sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or a history of syncope are more likely to experience a future arrhythmic event than asymptomatic patients.[7] Fever has been described as a trigger for the Brugada waveform or SCA.[8] Among patients with asymptomatic type 1 BS, the risk of fatal arrhythmic events is 0.5%–0.8%/year in spontaneous pattern, 0%–0.35%/year in drug-induced pattern, and 0.9%/year in fever-induced pattern.[2] Early repolarization is a common ECG finding and characterized by J point elevation ≥0.1 mV in ≥2 continuous inferior and lateral leads displaying either a slurred or notched morphology. Studies have reported that early repolarization increases the risk for SCD.[9] BS with early repolarization has a greater risk for arrhythmic events than BS without early repolarization.[10] In addition, inferolateral early repolarization location confers a higher risk of arrhythmia.Based on his history of present illness and ECG, we diagnosed the patient with BS and assumed that this was induced by fever. Moreover, there was inferolateral early repolarization [Figure 1, No. 2-5]. These findings suggest that the patient was at high risk for arrhythmic events. Therefore, an ICD was implanted.Sonoda et al. reported that HC was more likely to cause J point elevation.[5] In this case, J point elevation in No. 1 ECG of normal serum calcium level is decreased compared to No. 2 ECG, which serum calcium level is still high. Although it is difficult to evaluate the extent of HC contribution to the J point elevation, this reduction of J point elevation after serum calcium level had been normalized could indicate that HC caused J point elevation and could be a part of trigger to the induction of arrhythmia. There are some case reports of Brugada-like ECG pattern and VF associated with HC due to hyperparathyroidism,[346] in which ICD was not implanted because hyperparathyroidism was thought to be the main cause. In our case, the patient had both fever and HC before cardiac arrest. The coved-type ST elevation was immediately resolved when the patient's fever improved. It indicates that HC was irrelevant, and fever was probably the only cause of arrhythmia. However, HC is also known to contribute to the induction of arrhythmia. Moreover, as the HC improved, the J point elevation also decreased. From this fact, we cannot deny the involvement of HC in the development of arrhythmia. The cause of HC was determined to be an ectopic parathyroid adenoma, and this patient had a nonfunctional pituitary adenoma with a nonfunctional adrenal tumor. Therefore, he was considered to have MEN1.ConclusionsBS can present in fatal arrhythmic events as in our case, which can be precipitated by fever. Even though the Brugada pattern improved after the fever had resolved, the J point elevation still persisted until calcium level improved, which indicates HC can be a potential trigger to the induction of VF.Financial support and sponsorshipNone.Conflicts of interestNone declared.Data availability statementNone.Ethical statementNone.ConsentWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images.Declaration of patient consentThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

### Response
To extract the clinical events and their related timestamps from the case report, we need to identify key events and their temporal relationships. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Admission to the hospital**: Timestamp 0
2. **Fever and rash onset**: 3 days before admission, which is -72 hours
3. **Diagnosis of acne and treatment with minocycline**: 4 weeks before fever and rash, which is -672 hours
4. **Increased WBC count, eosinophilia, systemic involvement**: At admission, timestamp 0
5. **Diagnosis of DRESS syndrome**: At admission, timestamp 0
6. **Diffuse erythematous or maculopapular eruption with pruritus**: At admission, timestamp 0
7. **Fever and rash persistence**: At admission, timestamp 0
8. **Discharge**: 1 day after admission, which is +24 hours

Now, let's extract the events from the case report:

- **46-year-old man**: Timestamp 0
- **Ulcerative colitis**: Timestamp 0
- **Malaise, fever, loss of appetite**: 3 days before admission, timestamp -72
- **Arrival at emergency department**: Timestamp 0
- **Blood pressure, heart rate, SpO2, respiratory rate, body temperature**: Timestamp 0
- **Cardiac arrest**: Timestamp 0
- **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)**: Timestamp 0
- **Defibrillation and adrenaline administration**: Timestamp 0
- **Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BS)**: Timestamp 0
- **Coved-type ST elevation in ECG**: Timestamp 0
- **Improvement with acetaminophen**: Timestamp 0
- **Hypercalcemia (HC) level of 14.8 mg/dL**: Timestamp 0
- **Hypotension and suspected septic shock**: Timestamp 0
- **Initiation of tazobactam-piperacillin and vasopressors**: Timestamp 0
- **Extubation on day 2**: +48 hours
- **Reoccurrence of fever and liver abscess diagnosis**: +120 hours
- **Change of antibiotics to meropenem and vancomycin**: +120 hours
- **Puncture drainage**: +120 hours
- **Positive pilsicainide test result**: +720 hours
- **Implantation of ICD**: +720 hours
- **Discharge**: +720 hours
- **Family history of sudden death**: Timestamp 0
- **High parathyroid hormone levels and Tc scintigraphy**: Timestamp 0
- **Tumor resection after discharge**: Timestamp 0
- **Pathological diagnosis of ectopic parathyroid adenoma**: Timestamp 0
- **CT and MRI revealing nonfunctional pituitary and adrenal tumors**: Timestamp 0
- **Diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)**: Timestamp 0

Here is the output in the requested format:
